<p>Dirt has been defined as “matter in the wrong place.”
It is very useful, and, indeed, indispensable, as earth in
a garden, but decidedly unbecoming and dirty when on your
face or clothes. In a similar way, most of the creatures
termed “vermin” are in themselves very graceful and beautiful
specimens of the Creator’s handiwork, but when they
encroach on man’s paths of progress and improvement
they become “vermin,” and though all life should be looked
upon as a fearful and wonderful thing, not to be lightly
taken from its possessor, they are then justifiably slain.</p>

<p>The little gentleman in black velvet&mdash;the mole&mdash;is a lovely-coated
little fellow, possessing many virtues, such as
courage, industry, and parental affection, but when he once
gets into your father’s garden, which has probably cost
money and exceeding care to render it neat and productive,
our little friend is transformed into one of the most troublesome
of “vermin,” and must be relentlessly sacrificed by
the trapper. If this is not done, Master Mole will himself
sacrifice the crops in his efforts to get at the worms, which,
as the late Charles Darwin so conclusively showed, are one
of the great regenerating forces of the land’s fertility.</p>

<p>Look at rats again. See how lithe and agile they are,
how fond of their young, and provident in storing food for
future consumption; yet they are without a redeeming excellency
if, like dirt, they are in the wrong place&mdash;as they
are, by the way, pretty certain to be.</p>

<p>Of the squirrel Mr. Ruskin, in his marvelously eloquent
way, has said: “Of all quadrupeds ... there is none
so beautiful or so happy as the squirrel. Innocent in all his
ways, harmless in his food, playful as a kitten, but without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
cruelty, and surpassing the dexterity of the monkey, with
the grace of a bird, the little dark-eyed miracle of the forest
goes from branch to branch more like a sunbeam than a living
thing. The chamois is slow to it, and the panther clumsy.
It haunts you, listens for you, hides from you, looks for you,
loves you, as if it were a plaything invented by the angel that
walks by your children.”</p>

<p>Alas! there is a reverse side to this beautiful word-picture
of the great art critic. The gamekeeper will tell you that
mischievous Master “Squiggy” is very fond of birds’ eggs&mdash;many
a tiny wren, and many a sweet-voiced blackbird has
discovered this also&mdash;and that he above all will often suck
the dove-hued eggs of the pheasant. Much, therefore, as I
admire this little creature when he is in his native firtree,
I shall tell you how to catch him alive, so that he may
be kept away from doing harm.</p>

<p>Again, the brilliant kingfisher, flashing by you like a beam
of azure light, is in his right place near the stickleback
pond, but on my trout river he is “vermin.” The same exposition
of the properties of vermin might be followed out in
reference to all the creatures I intend to hereafter teach you
how to capture or destroy.</p>

<p>So much by way of introduction, and now suppose, as I
have above referred to “the little gentleman in the velvet
suit,” we begin with him. Do not be alarmed at the few
items of natural history I am going to give you in reference
to each “varmint.” It is better for you to know about the
funny little ways of the lower creation now than wait till
you are men, and perhaps unable to devote much time to
the acquisition of such knowledge. Besides, there is nothing
mean or paltry in such studies. Why, the great German
Heber and our hardly less great Sir John Lubbock have devoted
their lives to ants and such small fry till marvels of
intelligence in these insects have been unfolded to their
wondering vision. Even the wise and mighty King Solomon
did not forget them. Do not despise small things because
they are small, therefore, for are we not ourselves as motes
and specks of dust in the sunbeam in the immensity of God?</p>

<p>I most, however, return to the mole, or you may accuse
me of preaching a sermon when you were expecting to hear
how to catch vermin.</p>

<p>Well, the scientific name of the mole is Talpa Europæa,
and its distribution is all over Europe. France, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Germany, Holland, Sweden, and Denmark alike
produce it as well as our own land. The main thing&mdash;or one
of them&mdash;that arrests the attention on first seeing the mole is
the very hand-like fore paws. These are attached to the
body by a short forearm, and suggest immense strength&mdash;which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
as a matter of fact, they possess. They are used for
scooping the earth from before and throwing it on one side;
and for this purpose the claws are long and trenchant. The
hind feet, which are comparatively small, serve the purpose
of throwing out the earth behind with incredible quickness.
The head also, being sharp-pointed, offers no opposition to
this boring through the soft soil, and the eyes, being so tiny,
are never injured by the soil through which the pointed snout
passes.</p>

<p>For a long time people failed to discover that the mole
possessed eyes, so rudimentary and hidden are they. They
are covered by the soft fur, and it is to be presumed that
as they are of little or no use in the total darkness of subterranean
passages, they serve only to apprise their owner
of the approach of light whenever it may find itself near the
surface of the ground. It sometimes has happened to me to
find a mole strayed from its habitation, I suppose, and on
the surface of the soil. From the experiment of putting an
obstacle in front of it, and its avoidance thereof, I have come
to the conclusion that it can see slightly, though it is evident
when you dissect the head that the organs of hearing
are vastly
more developed
than those
of sight.
The sense
of smell is
perhaps
stronger
than that
of hearing&mdash;as
one
would infer from the long, pointed, greyhound-like snout;
and this should be borne in mind when setting the trap. If
indeed, in the case of any animal, you are told that the sense
of smell is well developed, handle the ginsnare or trap as little
as possible with the naked hand. There is a distinctive
odor in the human hand which animals, whether vermin or
not, seem instantly to recognize.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 2.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Moles construct a fortress, or habitation, under a hillock
or some such convenient protection as a sort of central position,
from which they proceed outwards through various
“runs” or roads in search of food (see <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>). This fortress
has a dome of earth, which is beaten hard by the creature,
and so rendered strong and impervious to rain, snow,
dews, or frost. <span class="smcap">A</span> in <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a> represents the hollow center,
which is also dry and hard, whilst <span class="smcap">B B B</span> signify the ramifying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
tunnels leading into the galleries of the central fortress,
and outwards to the tracts for feeding and exploration, as
well as to the nests of the various pairs of sexes forming
the community. Along these tracts the individuals travel
and obtain their livelihood, never stopping to gossip; for if,
indeed, one mole meets another by chance, one must turn
out of the way into the nearest alley, or there is a “row,”
which generally means death to the weaker&mdash;for, let me
tell you, Mr. Talpa is a very pugnacious little man when
thwarted.</p>

<p>Of course, you know that the food of the mole is chiefly
comprised of worms&mdash;and speaking of that reminds me of a
method I once saw of catching moles, which was cruel but
very singular. I was fishing on the Colne, near Wraysbury,
and I noticed an old man in the field behind me industriously
going over the ground, and here and there drawing out a
live mole by means of what seemed a string.</p>

<p>I laid down my rod and went over to him, and after a
little persuasion I got to understand the whole bag of
tricks. His method was to dig down to a fresh tunnel and
“lay” a lobworm, threaded on a rather small fish-hook tied
on fine brass wire, covering in the hole with leaves and dirt
and securing the wire by a string to a stout peg. The mole,
being almost sure to return, would thus take the bait, and
in most cases get hooked in the mouth. This seems to me,
however, a needlessly cruel way of mole-catching when
there are others quite as effectual and practically painless,
and I shall therefore not go any farther into the particulars
necessary for its practice.</p>

<p>Moles are extremely voracious and, this being so, they
crave and enjoy large quantities of water. I have frequently
watched moles descending by a beaten run to the
water&mdash;and, indeed, just opposite where I am writing there
is a tiny roadway from a mole hillock to the neighboring
ditch. Should a plentiful supply such as this not be handy,
the little animal sinks a well for himself, beating the interior
hard and forming quite a little shaft, which receives
the rain and stores it. I came across one some time ago
which was quite a foot in depth and almost full.</p>

<p>I have said that there is a fortress usually built by a colony
of moles in the approximate form of <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, and so there
is. The aim of the mole-catcher should be if possible to find
out where this central position is and cut off retreat. I have
seen the mole-catcher in Windsor Park dig the moles out
on finding out this metropolis of moles&mdash;as it might be fitly
called.</p>

<p>It has been proved that immediately on anything very
alarming occurring, they forsake their explorations and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
flee into the citadel. This is how it was done and who did
it.</p>

<p>Monsieur le Court, a French gentleman, very sensibly believing
that there was little else but horror and danger in
the tumult and bloodshed of the great French Revolution,
fled from the court where he had waited on and been the
companion of the highest, and secluded himself in the depth
of the country to become the historian and friend of the humble
La Taupe, as the French term the mole. M. Geoffrey St.
Hillaire visited him, and together they watched their opportunity
till one of the moles had penetrated far from the fortress
in search of food.</p>

<p>Le Court then placed straws with little flags on the end out
of the ground at intervals in the passage behind the mole in
such a way that if the creature fled back again it would infallibly
knock them down. With a trumpet buried, leaving
the mouth-piece out of the ground,
he blew a blast loud enough to shake
the good-nature out of the best toy of
your acquaintance, and instantly one
after the other, almost as fast as a
horse can trot, down went the little
flags till the central home was reached.
The mole usually builds at the intersection
of several of the roads and not
in the habitation. Its nest consists of
fibers and dried grass, straw, etc.,
and the young seldom number more
than five. Moles will sometimes take
the water, but such instances are extremely
rare; there is no reason, however,
why it should not be a good
swimmer, its front paws being so
spatulous and strong.</p>

<div id="Fig_3" class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="200" height="529" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 3. <span style="padding-left:4em">Fig. 4.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Mole trapping is very seldom practiced,
except by professionals, who besides
the blood money generally
awarded on the production of each
mole’s tail, make a very nice little
amount by selling the skins. Still
there is nothing difficult about mole
catching, and the most stupid boy
could render himself successful if he observes a little and
follows the directions I am about to give. First, then as to
tools, which are indispensable when one is out for a day’s
trap-setting. <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a> shows an implement which at A consists
of an iron heavy spike which is used for making holes
for the insertion of the spring stick of the trap to be described<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
presently. B is the wooden haft&mdash;ash is as good as any; C
is a sort of spatula or little spade for digging into a mole
run. <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 4</a> shows a light hatchet or a rather long handle
for cutting hazel or ash-spring sticks, pointing them, etc.</p>

<div id="Fig_5" class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/i008a.jpg" width="120" height="406" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 5.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now as to the traps themselves. <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a> shows
the iron trap, usually sold with galvanized uprights
and claws. A indicates the spring which,
on the mole by placing its head in the circular
orifice of B releasing the latter, closes the claws
to, killing the mole instantly. B, of course, is a
movable tongue of the shape shown at C, and
ought to be tied to the body of the trap in case
the mole should by any means escape, pulling
the tongue (C) after it. This is, of course, a
very neat kind of trap, but a dozen of them
would come expensive, and besides, I do not
prefer them in actual practice on a large scale,
as they are by no means so likely to be viewed
without suspicion by the mole as are the homespun
traps I am going to describe.</p>

<p>Get a strip of wood (deal is as good as anything)
about six inches long by four broad and
half an inch thick, like <span class="smcap">D</span>, <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>. Bore nine
holes in it, four for the reception of the ends of two half circular
hoofs of wood shown at A, and four smaller ones for
the two wires at
<span class="smcap">A</span>2 <span class="smcap">A</span>2 to pass
through. One
largish hole is
made in the center,
and through
this passes a
cord with a knot
at the end (<span class="smcap">C</span>).
<span class="smcap">B</span> shows a piece
of wood cut like
a little spatula
with a somewhat
blunt handle or
head (see <span class="smcap">B</span>2).
This tongue is
placed against
the knot when
the spring hazel
stick <span class="smcap">E</span> is in position
as in <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>. I want you to look carefully at <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a> because
it very nearly explains itself.</p>

<p>The whole apparatus is buried in the ground in the run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of a mole, and fastened down by sticks stuck athwart and
across, as shown at <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>. The stick <span class="smcap">E</span> is thus kept in position
by the knot <span class="smcap">C</span> and the tongue <span class="smcap">B</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>2. When a mole
passes through the circular loops at <span class="smcap">A A</span> it hits its nose
against <span class="smcap">B</span> and knocks it out, releasing the knot <span class="smcap">C</span>, which in
turn releases the bent stick, up this flies, and one of the wires
<span class="smcap">A</span>2 are bound to catch the hapless Talpa, compressing it so
strongly as to kill it almost instantly.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 7.</p></div>
</div>

<p>These are the
details of how to
set the trap.
Having found
out a run where
the mole-heaps
are fresh, or have
recently been
thrown up, cut
down with the
spade end of your
tool (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>) into it, and with your hands take out the dirt,
feeling for and making clear the direction of the passage each
way. Now with the pointed end of <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a> make a hole slantwise,
but not too much so, for the insertion of <span class="smcap">E</span> (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>),
which should be a hazel, withy, or ash stick from half an inch
in diameter. Adjust the string of the trap to the top of it,
and then set the tongue, carefully spreading the loops of wire
within the hoops. Now, with the left hand on the trap, and
assisted by the knee, bend the spring stick down, place the
trap in its position, and with the right hand force in some
short hazel sticks across and across, as shown in <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>. This
done, your trap is set, and a turf can be broken up and spread
round the top of it, to keep out any light, from the interior
of the run. If my readers have carefully gone through this
explanation with me there is no fear but that they will be
able to make and set the trap&mdash;and also catch moles.</p>

<p>Damp weather, or after a warm shower, is the best time
to set these traps; and as many as twenty or thirty should
be systematically set per day while moles exist and good
weather lasts. The straightened character of the stick will
infallibly indicate when the trap is sprung, and if no mole
be caught move it a little farther away, but not away from
the colony entirely, and set again.</p>

<p>The skins of the moles are in best condition in autumn,
and if a sufficient number be properly cured, and set together
by a professional furrier, a warm and rich garment, either
cloak, hat, or waistcoat can be made. I have a mole-skin
waistcoat I have worn for four winters, and it is far from being
worn out yet. Queen Victoria has eight hundred skins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
sent annually to Windsor Castle by the Park mole-catcher,
for preparation and making up. I dare say this man catches
two or three thousand moles every year, and yet the number
seem not to decline, so unfailing is the multiplication of
these velvety little fellows.</p>

<p>The professional mole-catcher usually skins his moles in a
very summary manner. Simply passing a very sharp knife
round the head, and cutting off the forefeet, he turns the
skin off inside out as I should do an eel. Indeed, it is a
more rapid process than eel-skinning, for I once had a match
with a mole-catcher, which was that I was to skin six fair-sized
eels, while he skinned six moles. I lost, though I
am exceedingly quick with eels, by one eel, much to my annoyance,
for I had loudly boasted of my dexterity. Having
skinned his mole as I described, the mole-catcher then
simply stuffs a pledget of hay or wadding into the skin and
leaves it to dry.</p>

<p>If you have time, however, it is much better to skin the
mole by making an incision down the belly, and taking off
the fur as you would do in the case of a rabbit. It should
then be tacked with small tin tacks to a dry board, the inside
toward you, and after removing with a blunt knife any
particles of fat, it should be dressed with a soap made as
follows:&mdash;whiting or chalk, <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> oz.; soft soap, 1 oz.;
chloride of lime, 2 oz. If these ingredients are not handy
powdered alum will serve, though not so well.</p>

<p>Now, one word in conclusion of this chapter on the mole,
and it will serve as good advice whenever you are trapping.
Be quiet; do not go lumbering all over the ground with the
tread of a cart-horse, for it must be borne in mind that the
mole has not only a good perception of actual sounds, but
an exquisite sense of vibration. Like a trout, the softest
tread will in some cases apprise it of danger and cause it to
retire to its citadel. Your object is to catch moles by cutting
off their retreat, for if they are in the central habitation
they may not take the route when next a start is made that
you desire and in which the trap is set.</p>

<h2><a id="II_THE_WEASEL_STOAT_AND_POLECAT">II.<br /><span class="chapterfont">THE WEASEL, STOAT AND POLECAT.</span></a></h2>


<p>“If we consider the animal creation on a broad scale, the
aggregate of living beings will be found to be the devourers
and destroyers of others.” The editor of Cassel’s Natural
History is responsible for this statement, and it struck me
as a forcible and appropriate one for this chapter on weasels,
etc. Without doubt the weasel, next to the rat, is one of the
most destructive of our vermin, preying as it does with extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
ferocity on leverets, chicken, young ducks, pigeons,
rabbits, in fact, on all creatures more timorous than
itself. Truly it is not a very formidable enemy to the
farmer in connection with his granaries and other stores, for
it is an inveterate slayer of ruts and mice, but the gamekeeper
cannot tolerate it. Its “treasons, stratagems and
spoils” are, without exception, excessive above all other of
the spoiling mammalia whatsoever.</p>

<p>Perhaps you doubt the conclusions to which I arrive in
reference to this pretty, brown-backed white-bodied little
animal, and there are some naturalists whose writings seem
to clothe it with very different characteristics. A certain
Mademoiselle de Laistre seems to contradict, in one of her
letters, the commonly received opinion that it cannot be domesticated.
She describes with touching minuteness how
her weasel would drink milk out of her hands and fondle with
her, showing signs of satisfaction and enjoyment, which could
scarcely be apart from intelligence. “The little creature,”
she says, “can distinguish my voice amid twenty others, and
springs over every one in the room till it finds me. Nothing
can exceed the lively and pleasing way it caresses me with its
two little paws; it frequently pats me on the chin in a manner
that expresses the utmost fondness. This, with a thousand
other kindnesses, convinces me of the sincerity of its
attachment. He is quite aware of my intention when dressed
to go out, and then it is with much difficulty I can rid myself
of him. On these occasions he will conceal himself behind a
cabinet near the door and spring on me as I pass with astonishing
quickness.”</p>

<p>This testimony would seem to rather invest <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><a id="Ref_11">mustela</a> vulgaris</i>
with domestic virtues at least rare in his family, and,
sooth to say, there is a vast crowd of witnesses waiting to be
heard, whose report of his character is far different. The
weasel, agile and lithe as he is, is ferocious to the degree
which scorns fear, and there are many instances wherein he
has attacked the absolute viceroy of creation&mdash;man.</p>

<p>I recollect once chasing a weasel with some determination
and finding myself suddenly confronted by some seven or
eight others, who ran up my legs and endeavored to reach
my face. Fortunately I beat them off and killed seven with
the stick I carried, but I feel satisfied I should not have
escaped so well if I had not stood my ground and luckily
possessed a stick.</p>

<p>I have frequently heard of similar experiences, and one I
find is recorded in a cutting from a Scotch newspaper in my
scrap-book.</p>

<p>One night, it appears, the father of Captain Brown, the
naturalist, was returning from Gilmerton, near Edinburgh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
by the Dalkeith road. He observed on the high ground at
a considerable distance betwixt him and Craigmillar Castle
a man who was leaping about performing a number of antic
gestures more like those of a madman than of a sane person.
After contemplating this apparently absurd conduct,
he thought it might be some unfortunate maniac, and,
climbing over the walls, made directly towards him. When
he got pretty near he saw that the man had been attacked,
and was defending himself against the assaults of a number
of small animals which he at first took for rats, but which,
in fact, turned out on getting closer, to be a colony of from
fifteen to twenty weasels, which the unfortunate man was
tearing from him and endeavoring to keep from his throat.
Had he not been a powerful man, capable of sustaining the
extreme fatigue of this singular exertion, he probably would
have succumbed to the repeated efforts made by the ferocious
little creatures to get at his throat. As it was, his
hands were much bitten, and bleeding profusely.</p>

<p>It further appears that the commencement of the battle
was nearly as follows. He was walking slowly through the
park when he happened to see a weasel. He ran at it, and
made several unsuccessful attempts to strike it with a small
cane he held in his hand. On coming near the rock, he got
between it and the animal, and thus cut off retreat. The
weasel squeaked out aloud, when a sortie of the whole colony
was made, and the affray commenced.</p>

<p>Apropos of this, I have read somewhere of a colony of
rats attacking a condemned criminal in the sewers of Paris&mdash;or
in a dungeon closely contiguous&mdash;and I can quite believe
that hunger and numbers would render these horrible
vermin capable of homicide.</p>

<p>I do not quite see how any one can pity the members of
this weasel family. Let any one of my boy readers hear the
agonized cries of a pursued rabbit as it finds its relentless foe
chasing it with a determination and persistence quite unequaled,
and he will probably find the American love of fair
play prompt him to take the weaker creature’s part.</p>

<p>Emphatically I declare it&mdash;a weasel never relinquishes its
quarry till the life’s blood has been sucked and the brain extracted
and eaten. Then wasteful as the little tyrant is, the
rats may have the remainder, whilst it seeks for more prey.
Its little finger-thick body and black, venom-leaden eyes
seem the incarnation of destructiveness, whilst over the
sharp incisive teeth rows might well be written</p>

<p class="center">“Ch’entrate lasciate ogni speranza,”
</p>

<p>the terrible epigraph Dante, in his wonderful “Divina Commedia,”
saw inscribed over the portals of the infernal
regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps there is one redeeming feature in all this pitiless
ferocity, and that is the indomitable courage with which
the weasel defends its young against all marauders. It
breeds as fast as a rabbit&mdash;that is, two or three, or even
more times in a year&mdash;and its nest of dried herbage and undergrowth
is generally made in the hollow of some old tree
or wall. Close by the nest may often be found the remains
of putrid mice, rats, birds, etc., which circumstance has
suggested to some naturalists the conclusion that the weasel
prefers carrion to fresh food. This is erroneous. It is true
that it hunts, like some dogs, entirely, or nearly so, by scent,
and will even follow the sightless mole through the interminable
windings of its burrow; but fresh flesh and blood
are its delight, and if there be a plentitude of food it disdains
all the grosser parts of its prey with a fastidiousness worthy
of Apicius, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gourmet</i>. The weasel generally produces
five or six young ones at a birth.</p>

<div id="Fig_11" class="figright" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" width="450" height="285" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 11.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I do not
counsel
sparing the
weasel any
more than
the rat. The
best place
for the gins
to be set is
underneath
a wall
whereby the
weasel is
known to
travel. The
best trap
unquestionably
is the steel trap, or gin, and the best bait is the
inside of a newly-killed rabbit. This is the concrete essence
of my experience. You can scent the bait with musk,
and this addition will often prove of exceeding service. At
the ends of drains, in the hollows of old buildings, in the
dry tracts of ditches, by old trees&mdash;all these are likely places
and a careful watch will often discover their tracks. In setting
the gin do not allow it to spring hard as if you expected
an elephant of the Jumbo type to tread on the plate. On
the contrary, let it spring very lightly, and if possible hang
the bait up, so that the creature puts a foot on the plate and
so gets caught. A very good sort of trap for open places is
a fall-trap, which may be made at home and is useful for
nearly all kinds of vermin, including even birds (See <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Some little explanation is needed for the complete understanding
of this trap. <span class="smcap">A</span> is a board hollowed near the letter
<span class="smcap">A</span> to relieve <em>e</em> when the trap falls. <span class="smcap">B</span> is a slab of lead or
iron cut to admit <em>a</em> and <em>f</em>; <em>h</em> is a hinge holding <em>c</em>, which,
when adjusted at <em>g</em>, impinges on <em>a</em>, and so sustains the slab
<span class="smcap">B</span>. On the little hooks <em>d</em> the bait is fixed, and the weasel
confidently places his foot on <em>e</em>. Of course <em>f</em> then springs
from <em>g</em> and down falls the slab, crushing the captive instantly.
A stone slab is quite as useful, if not more so, than
lead or iron, and it is evident that this fall-trap can be set
with the greatest ease and delicacy.</p>

<div id="Fig_12" class="figright" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 12.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The next useful trap is termed “The Fig. 4 Trap,” from
its resemblance to that character, and is shown in the engraving
(<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>). This consists of a large slab of stone,
metal, or wood, propped up by three pieces of wood (<span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span> and
<span class="smcap">C</span>). If the engraving be carefully examined it will be seen to
consist of
a perpendicular
<span class="smcap">A</span>,
of a horizontal
bar
<span class="smcap">C</span>, at one
end of
which is
attached
the bait <span class="smcap">D</span>,
and of a
slanting
stick <span class="smcap">B</span>.
The upright
<span class="smcap">A</span> is
usually
half an
inch square, and cut to a sort of chisel-shape at top; a notch
is also cut in the side of the stretcher <span class="smcap">C</span>, as shown in the
side diagram <em>x</em>, to prevent it slipping down; and a notch is
also cut at the top of <span class="smcap">B</span> to receive the upright, as well as in
<span class="smcap">C</span>, to fix it, <span class="smcap">B</span> being at this latter point of a chisel shape. It
will be obvious to the attentive reader that if this trap be set
carefully, and with a sufficiency of delicacy, a very slight
tug at <span class="smcap">D</span> will be sufficient to bring down the slab, crushing
the animal, or, if a hollow be made in the ground, imprisoning
it. This trap, for nearly all vermin (of course, except
moles), is very cheap and effective; and for cats&mdash;in their
wrong places, of course&mdash;is remarkably useful, especially if
<span class="smcap">D</span> represent a sponge, on which tincture of valerian or oil of
rhodium has been sprinkled. One advantage of this trap is
that it is inexpensive, and not likely to be coveted by anybody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
else. The gin has, however, preference in my mind
over other artificial traps for weasels, and I counsel all my
readers to adopt it as the surest if their pockets will sustain
the initial expense. There is, however, nothing lost in endeavoring
to make your own traps, for such perseverance
implies interest in the pursuit of trapping, and this necessarily
is the central motive towards the acquirement of natural
knowledge.</p>

<p>There is one method of capturing weasels which I have
found very useful, though it entails the loss of an innocent
live bird in many cases. Form a sort of oblong square with
brushwood and close it all in except two narrow lanes leading
to the center, at which point peg down a young chicken
or bird. Set the traps, as closely concealed as possible at
the ends of these lanes, so that neither by ingress nor egress
can the weasel escape without the chance of being caught.
Each trap should be set very lightly, and in some dry ditch
near a covert, or by the side of a wall, or, in fact, in any
likely spot recognized by the trained eye.</p>

<p>Here is another bad character in the polecat, or foumart,
and as it is the largest of the two, it commonly does most
damage, though in saying this I really am not sure I can
place either or them first in this respect. The weasel and
polecat are unmitigated robbers and assassins, and according
to opportunity are given indifferently to bad habits of the
worst character. The polecat is, however, nearly sixteen inches
from that to eighteen inches in length, and its bite is
terrific and sometimes poisonous. Beware, therefore, of it
when releasing one caught in a trap; in fact, as I before impressed
on you, “kill it first.” The body of the polecat has
a woolly undercoat of pale yellow, while the longer hairs are
of a deep glossy brown.</p>

<p>Its habits are very similar to those of the weasel, and it
commonly kills chickens by biting the head off and then sucking
the blood, leaving perhaps a dozen bodies as mementoes
of its visitation. I have known it to catch fish, and I caught
one in a trap, set as I supposed at the time, for an otter.
The otter turned out to be a polecat, however, which measured,
exclusive of the tail, fourteen inches. Eels seemed to
be the prey for which it took water, as I had previously found
the remains of several half-eaten on the shore.</p>

<p>This circumstance was a strange one to me, and altogether
exceptional, until I looked up my natural history books,
when I found that Bewick refers to a similar fact in his
“Quadrupeds.” He says:&mdash;“During a severe storm one of
these animals was traced in the snow from the side of a rivulet
to its hole at some distance from it.... Its
hole was examined, the foumart taken, and eleven fine eels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
were discovered as the fruits of its nocturnal exertions. The
marks on the snow were found to have been made by the
motions of the eels while in the creature’s mouth.” We
have no reason for doubting Bewick, but it is certain that
the polecat must have extracted the eels from either beneath
stones or mud, where, during cold weather such as described,
it is their infallible habit to retire in a semi-torpid condition.</p>

<p>In trapping it use a strong gin, and set very lightly. The
baits are precisely similar to those for the weasel. Be,
above all, careful to use the naked hands as little as possible.</p>

<h2><a id="III_RATS">III.<br /><span class="chapterfont">RATS.</span></a></h2>


<p>Rats may, I think, fairly lay claim to being the most mischievous
of all vermin. They are fellows of irreclaimably
bad habits, and never so happy as when devouring or destroying
something. Artemus Ward has placed it on record
that “Injins is pisen wherever you meet ’em,” and the same
might be said of rats. In that exquisitely whimsical
poem of Browning’s, “The Pied Piper of Hamelin,” we are
told that the townspeople were plagued emphatically with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indenttwo">“Rats!</div>
<div class="indentbase">They fought the dogs and killed the cats,</div>
<div class="indentone">And bit the babies in their cradles,</div>
<div class="indentbase">And ate the cheeses out of the vats,</div>
<div class="indentone">And licked the soup from the cook’s own ladles.</div>

<div class="indentone">With shrieking and squeaking</div>
<div class="indentbase">In fifty different sharps and flats.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I have not the least doubt but that they did all this and
other things worse; hence I would say with no uncertainty,
“Slay all and spare none,” whenever you get a chance. I
do not know of one redeeming feature in the character of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mus decumanus</i> unless it be good in a pie, as our friend
the Rev. J. G. Wood hints that it is from experimental trial.</p>

<p>Hundreds on hundreds of tales relating to its cunning or
intelligence might be cited until you were heartily tired of
reading, much less I of writing. How rats will bite holes
in leaden pipes, attack the face of a sleeping infant&mdash;an instance
of which I might relate from actual knowledge&mdash;how
they devour each other, leaving only the skin turned inside
out as neatly as you could turn a stocking, and last, but far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
from least, how they have been trained to perform a drama
in pantomime and various other tricks quite too numerous
to refer to here. The rat is practically omnivorous, and so
gets his living where more select appetites and digestions
would starve. “Hit him ’ard, he ain’t a’ got no friends,”
as was said of the pauper boy in “Oliver Twist.” Every
creature’s hand seems turned against him, and we, agreeably
to this bent of nature, will now proceed to compass his destruction
by means of trapping.</p>

<div id="Fig_8" class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i017a.jpg" width="400" height="82" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 8.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Unquestionably the best trap is the common iron gin.
Everybody knows what that is like, with its centre plate
and formidable rows of teeth on either side the jaws. I shall
therefore spare you a drawing and description of it, and content
myself with simply advising that the teeth be of the
shape shown at <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>&mdash;that is, square points fitting when
closed in half
circles. Now
this form of
tooth does
not cut
through the
limb of the
captured animal so readily as the saw-shaped does, and is
preferable on that account. Rats are very prone to gnaw
through a fractured limb and free themselves&mdash;they will not
do this nearly so readily, however, if the teeth be of the
shape indicated. This is also the best shape for the capture
of other vermin, as we shall see as these chapters
proceed.</p>

<div id="Fig_9" class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/i017b.jpg" width="120" height="459" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 9.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In all cases a chain about eighteen inches is attached
by means of an S hook in the gin. A swivel
should be placed about the middle, and a ring of
about an inch and a quarter should terminate it. A
good stout stake, about eighteen inches long, is
also necessary, and ash is particularly recommendable
if it can be procured. If it be trimmed when
cut, like <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>, so that a short piece of branch
keeps the ring from slipping off, so much the better.
Another tool which is ever useful when gins are
being set (and that will be pretty frequent with the
vermin I shall speak about) is a hammer shaped
something like <a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>. You will see that it has a
broad, hatchet-like form to it instead of the claws
of an ordinary hammer, and this is for cutting into the earth,
separating roots, etc. In twenty ways it comes in useful, so
I advise my readers to get one made after this pattern.</p>

<div id="Fig_10" class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="400" height="178" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 10.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Be careful in setting your trap to keep your fingers well
away from the teeth, and to do this observe the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
method. Place your right foot upon the spring firmly, and
as the jaws fall back, quickly lift the catch over with your
right hand; then, without relaxing pressure, raise the plate
of the trap from underneath until it allows of the catch to
meet the nick in the plate. Set them lightly or hard, according
to the animal to be trapped. Experience will soon
enable you to judge how this should be for a rat. A fine
sieve is generally
used by trappers to
sift dirt over the
trap when set, but
you can dispense
with this if you wear
gloves. In rat-trapping,
by the by,
always wear thick
gloves; rats can
smell you infallibly.</p>

<p>You can easily detect a rat-run, and quite as easily tell if
it be fresh or not, by noticing the appearance of the excrement.
Having determined on a fresh run, endeavor so to
set your trap that the catch shall be light, and the whole affair
completely hidden from sight, the pan or plate being
baited with whatever seems to have been the recent food, or
food most likely to be got near by the run. For rats in runs
where they come to feed, by walls, rick-sides, or places at
which they appear most, the traps should be set. When
the run appear stale or not much used, they should be
shifted to other places. For rats a great variety of baits
may be used, but the best is generally something like what
they are in the habit of feeding upon on farm premises;
grain, with sufficient chaff or cut hay to cover the bottom,
meal mixed with sweet broth or small bits of meat. Rats
may be enticed with oils of aniseed, thyme, and rhodium,
and when traps are new and smell of the shop a few drops
should be rubbed inside the bottom of the traps to take the
other smell away. By using a drag of these oils, rubbed on
a herring or a piece of clean rag, rats may be enticed a long
way.</p>

<p>A capital bait for old poaching rats&mdash;such as would not
hesitate to kill your spring chickens or young rabbits&mdash;is
the drawing of game of any sort, or the young of pigeons or
young birds. I have also found the following a capital
dodge to enable one to overcome the cunning of an old buck
rat. Get some sprats and pound them. Put them in glass
bottles and cork and seal, and hang them up in the sun for
three weeks or so, or put them on a dung-hill of moderate
heat. This will entirely decompose and resolve them into an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
oily substance exceedingly bad smelling. Pour some of this
on a rag and drag it about from a common center where the
trap is, and indeed it is well to drag it after one as the traps
are seen to successively. The trap bait should be roasted
salt fish. A kippered herring does famously, and a few drops
of oil of aniseed can be put on the bait. I have known this
to be exceedingly successful.</p>

<p>A similar sort of treatment is necessary for the water-rat.
There is, however, but little necessity to use baits if the trap
be set under water at the spot where the creature emerges.
The precise place can be easily seen, and its freshness or
staleness as a “run” be determined in the same way as that
of a brown rat. The water-rat is easily distinguished from
its cousin the brown by the tail of the former being covered
with hair and that of the latter with scales, of which there are
200 rows. It must not be supposed, however, because
the water-rat derives its living from the water chiefly that it
is not a destructive creature inland. A very interesting
writer says: “We have seen water-rats cross a wide meadow,
climb the stalks of the dwarf beans, and after detaching the
pods with their teeth, shell the beans in a most woman-like
manner.” They are also said to mount vines and feed on
grapes, and I can verify that they are fond of plums from
the following incident:</p>

<p>Between my study window and the margin of a stream at
the foot of my garden stand two tall trees of the bullace plum,
and this year they have been unusually full of fruit. I placed
a ladder against one of the trees in order to pick the plums,
but rain or some other interference prevented my doing so at
the intended time; thus the ladder remained for some days.
Now I have a large tabby cat, and besides a good rat-killer
she is fond of birds, and strangely enough will climb trees
and spring at a bird within reach, in nine cases out of ten
falling to the ground with her captive in her mouth. As I sat
writing one morning Tabby mounted her coign of vantage by
means of the ladder, and scaled to the topmost height, enjoying
the sunshine, and not, I fancy, on this occasion waiting
for prey. However, good things come when least expected,
and presently Tabby and I both beheld a large water-rat&mdash;unseen
by the latter, of course&mdash;approach the ladder,
and after peering slyly round, began to mount it, which he
did with remarkable agility. On reaching the first large
branch he stepped on it, and without the least hesitation made
for a cluster of the plums and began his feast. I told you
Tabby saw him as well as I, and I would have given much
too if she had not. As Mr. Rat sat absorbed with his back
to her, like a jungle leopard, creeping with silent certainty
on its innocent, unsuspecting prey, Tabby slowly approached,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and the steadfast glare in her greenish eyes was full of a deadly
purpose, which gathered strength as she progressed. Presently,
when within three feet of the still gourmandizing rat,
her fell purpose culminated in a terrific but unerring spring,
which tumbled rat and cat out of the tree to the ground.
Habet! alas! he had it, and after a few terrific crunches of
her jaws Tabby rose from the body proudly, with swinging
tail and a victorious air, which as plainly as language conveyed
infinite self-complacency at the death-dealing deed.</p>

<p>These rats are more clever in boring their tunnels than the
brown species, resembling, in fact, the ingenuity of the mole
rather than the rat. They are much more cleanly also.
Should you get an apple or pear or melon which has been
bitten by a brown rat you will instantly detect it by its peculiar
musty odor and taste. The water-rat is, on the contrary,
a much more cleanly animal, and its flesh is not uncommonly
eaten by the French peasants on <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maigre</i> days.
It breeds in the spring, and again in autumn if the spring
litter be very early, bringing forth five or six at a time. The
nest is usually by the side of a river or stream. In the roots
of an old willow tree just opposite my house I found six nests
this year. Not that these rats will not at times build away
from the water. I know of several instances, as a neighbor
was plowing in a dry, chalky field, far removed from any
water, he turned out a water rat that was curiously laid up
in an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hybernaculum</i> artificially formed of grass and leaves.
At one end lay about a gallon of potatoes, regularly stowed,
on which it was to have supported itself for the winter.</p>

<p>When a rat is caught in a gin always be careful to keep
your hand at a distance on releasing it. In fact, do not let
it go at all, but kill it at once. I do not like the idea of letting
a suffering animal be farther tormented by dogs, or even
cats. There can be no true sport in it except, perhaps, to
the savage instincts of the dog, and why a human being
should find cruel sport for a dog I cannot tell you.</p>

<p>The other species, the black rat (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mus rattus</i>), is perhaps
a more ancient importation even than the brown. It is,
however, scarcer than either of the others. Its colors are
grayish black above and ash-colored, and beneath it is about
seven and a half inches long when full grown.</p>

<p>Ferrets are often employed to aid in exterminating the
brown rat. The ferret is of no use whatever for the water-rat,
though it is certainly extremely useful when barns, wood-heaps,
and such like erections are infested. The gun is the
thing, in the hands of an experienced sportsman, to kill them
as the ferrets force them to leave their homes, but a few sharp
dogs and a half dozen sharp school-fellows with sticks will
produce very certain destruction. Be careful not to mistake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the head of a ferret coming out of a hole for that of a
rat, as once happened to me in this wise. I was staying at
a farm-house, and it was proposed one fine December morning
to try an hour or two’s ferreting. My school chum, with
whom I was staying, possessed some very tame and good
working ferrets, one in particular, a fine brownish dog ferret,
by which he set great store. The great wheat barn was to
be laid siege to, and he being a good shot and older than I,
took down his gun and loaded it preparatory to starting.</p>

<p>“Jack,” said he to me, “you can shoot, can’t you?” I
was but fourteen then and a school boy, and I fear I answered
rather too readily and without sufficient modesty,
“Oh, yes; have you a gun to spare?” Yes, he had a single-barrel
pretty little weapon, and, proud as a cock-robin, I
sallied forth, on mighty shots intent. “Now,” said he,
with emphasis, “stand here; watch that hole, and as soon
as you see the <em>whole</em> of a rat’s body fire away, but be careful
not to kill a ferret, which you may easily do if you fire too
hastily.” I recollect I rather scorned the idea of mistaking
a ferret for a rat, and with steadfast attention prepared to
kill the first of the rodents that appeared. It seemed an
age, and then one swiftly popped his head out and bolted past
me, my fire hitting the ground at least a yard behind him.
How savage I was! not to speak of the half sneers of my
companions. Next time I would be ready. Ah! there was
a slight movement in the hole, a small nose poked itself out
and then disappeared. I pointed the gun straight for the
hole. Out it came again, and then a brown head swiftly
appeared. Bang! Hurrah! I had killed him. Round came
the boys. “Well done,” said my friend Ted, as he stooped
to draw out the murdered wretch. “Why, you duffing idiot,
you’ve killed my best dog ferret!” Moral, do not jump at
conclusions.</p>

<h2><a id="IV_THE_OTTER">IV.<br /><span class="chapterfont">THE OTTER.</span></a></h2>


<p>The otter is one of the most graceful of living creatures,
but as a fisherman and fishculturist, I candidly confess that
I look on him as a detestable nuisance on my river. What
says the poet!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentthree">“Nor spears</div>
<div class="indentbase">That bristle on his back defend the perch</div>
<div class="indentbase">From his wide, greedy jaws; nor burnished mail</div>
<div class="indentbase">The yellow carp; nor all his arts can save</div>
<div class="indentbase">Th’ insinuating eel, that hides his head</div>
<div class="indentbase">Beneath the slimy mud; nor yet escapes</div>
<div class="indentbase">The crimson-spotted trout, the river’s pride</div>
<div class="indentbase">And beauty of the stream.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a faithful picture of the otter’s remorseless and predacious
nature. I caught one the other day in an eel-grate,
whither he had doubtless gone for the eels. The biter was,
however, bit, for the rush of water was too powerful, and
on opening the door in the morning I found him dead and
stiff.</p>

<p>The otter usually kills many more fish than it actually
wants for food, and as otters generally hunt in pairs, it is
not uncommon to find in the morning as many as thirteen
or fourteen prime trout&mdash;in an ordinarily plentiful river, of
course&mdash;killed and only partly eaten. Like the lord mayor’s
jester, however, the otter knows what is good, or, indeed,
best, for it eats away the shoulders of the fish, leaving
the rest to rot or be devoured by rats.</p>

<p>I have said it is graceful, and so it is, in a remarkable degree.
Let me advise you, if you live in New York, to visit
the Zoological Gardens, in Central Park, and watch the fine
sinuous turns and sweeps as the otter seizes or seeks for its
prey. Its body is long and flexible, and its feet short and
webbed, and the adjacent muscles are of immense muscular
power. Its eyes are large, the ears short, and it is bewhiskered
like a Viking. Its coat is double, like that of the
seal. Long glossy hairs form the outer one, and a short
waterproof woolly waistcoat comprises the inner, so that
neither cold nor wet can affect the well-being of this amphibious
hunter. In the daytime it hides itself in its hole,
which usually is some feet deep in the bank, <em>above</em> highwater
mark, but at night its depredations commence; and
when the female has young, say five, and the male otter
works with her, as he generally does, I estimate that from
thirty to forty fish per night are, if anything, rather within
the number than beyond. Can any one deny, therefore,
that the otter comes within the common-sense definition of
vermin?</p>

<p>If the otter be taken young, and great kindness and care
be shown it, it may be transferred from the category of vermin
into that of “pets,” and I do not think there is a much
more interesting pet in existence, and I recollect one which
used to run about after its master at Eton, England, some
years since. A friend of mine (head river-keeper on a nobleman’s
estate) took a tame one from an old poacher which
the latter had constantly employed to catch fish and bring to
him. My friend tells me that when he caught the poacher he
had some sixty fine trout, scarcely injured, in a bag, all of
which had been captured by the otter.</p>

<p>There are many instances of a similar character referred
to in the natural history books which I cannot produce here.
It is sufficient to say that otter-taming, and even the utilizing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the creature for fishing purposes, is by no means uncommon.</p>

<p>The otter is usually hunted with dogs of a particular
breed, but I shall not attempt to describe this species of
sport in this place. There are those who object to hunting
on principle, and I am not bigoted enough to say they are
altogether wrong. Certain, however, it is that otter hunting
is remarkably exhilarating, and there is a great deal of
fun to be got out of the mishaps which are sure to ensue to
the hunters as they scamper and splash and rush and dash
over the bowlders, through bush and brier and stream and
rivulet, till the wily brute is either caught or “kenneled.”
So far as we are now concerned, I shall content myself
with telling you how to trap this vermin of the water, and
if ever you become possessed of a stream or lake of fish do
not forget that the otter is your chiefest enemy&mdash;excepting
the human poacher, of course.</p>

<p>Now we will presume you are one morning early taking a
walk by the side of your favorite stream. On each side the
willows and alders bend over the water and their roots
clutch the banks with rugged fingers, forming coverts for
rats, moorhens, dabchicks, and other small fry, as well as
for the quiet-loving trout.</p>

<p>Presently, as you attentively note these features, you are
aware of a sort of footpath proceeding from the stream, and
on looking closer you notice that fresh excrement has been
left and that footprints of a dog-like animal are to be seen
in the soft earth. Follow this trail and perchance, ere many
steps have been taken, you come upon the carmine-spotted
body of a two-pound trout, minus head and shoulders, or a
pound silver eel with its broadest part eaten away. You now
know that an otter has been at work, and you must vow that
he shall die. But how? Listen. The track is fresh. Good!
Procure the largest rabbit-gin you can, and after attaching
it firmly to a stake driven under water, drive two more
sticks under water exactly where the otter comes ashore,
and set it upon them. Do not bait the trap at all, or the
otter will not come near, but simply set it under water, so
that when his ottership comes to bank with his ill-gotten
booty he puts his foot on the plate of the gin. A good plan
also, where this one is not practicable, is to carefully cut up
a sod of dirt in the pathway of the otter, and set the gin
very gingerly, covering it up completely with short grass
and a sprinkling of dirt. In any case use gloves, so that
your hands are not smelt, for, strange as it may seem in an
animal getting its food by sight, the sense of smell is exquisitely
developed in the otter. When caught be very careful
not to handle him. His teeth are “orful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Daniel, in his “Rural Sports,” says “the trap must be set
in and covered with mud to prevent the otter seeing it. The
instant the trap strikes, the otter plunges into the water with
it, when its weight preventing his rising to the surface soon
destroys him.” But I incline to my own plan
in preference. Of course, if the “spoor,”
“spraint,” or “seal” cannot be seen it is advisable
to set several traps at intervals along
the bank, covering them lightly with moss.</p>

<h2><a id="V_THE_SQUIRREL">V.<br /><span class="chapterfont">THE SQUIRREL.</span></a></h2>


<p>At the commencement of this series of articles
I referred to the squirrel, and quoted the
words in which Mr. Ruskin describes his unbounded
admiration for this sprightly little fellow.
The squirrel has a very voracious appetite,
however, and if he once by accident or design
tastes the luscious richness of pheasant or partridge
egg he becomes a poacher of very extreme
character. Game-keepers do not object
to squirrels as a rule, as long as they confine
themselves to those parts of a covert where
game are not, though in the case of largely
stocked preserves these parts are not easily
found.</p>

<p>When Master “Squiggy,” however, takes to
sucking eggs and teaching his grandmother
and uncles, aunts and cousins, to do the same,
then it becomes a manifest duty to snare him
and take him away if you do not kill him. Of
course it is not likely that my boy readers will
be called upon to assist professionally in such a
proceeding, but I will briefly describe how squirrels
may be caught alive, for when removed
from the place of mischief they make capital
pets after a time of patience and taming.</p>

<div id="Fig_1" class="figleft" style="width: 77px;">
<img src="images/i024.jpg" width="77" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 1.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is necessary for two to embark in the proceedings
that follow. One is the climber, and
he, I need scarcely say, should be a tolerably
good one. A pair of climbing irons are almost
indispensable, and I should certainly advise
boys to get them. He is also provided with a
long pole with a loop of fine twisted brass wire
attached to it (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>Now let us term these two warriors <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>. Having
spotted a squirrel and observed him run up a tree, A attaches
his irons and prepares to climb. Before this is done <span class="smcap">B</span> stands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
beneath the tree and attracts the squirrel’s attention, and
keeps his eye fixed on him, <span class="smcap">B</span> never moving from where he
stands. Meanwhile <span class="smcap">A</span> is gradually approaching from behind
the squirrel, and when he is near enough he slips the loop
over the creature’s head, gives a sharp wrench, and lets the
pole, squirrel, and all drop to the ground to be secured by
<span class="smcap">B</span>. Of course the squirrel is almost choked, but a firm hand
in a thick leather glove soon releases the frightened animal,
and you have to do with him as your pleasure will. You
ought to take a bag with you and instantly pop him into it.
This is the way the men catch squirrels in the country, and
is far better than trapping them so as to cause pain.</p>

<p>I have thus told you how to catch squirrels without materially
hurting them, and I suppose I may as well tell you
how to keep them. Well, having caught the lively young
gentleman, keep him in the dark for a day or two, only
occasionally letting him get a glance of the outer world.
Feed him during this period with beechnuts, chestnuts, and
by all means let him have plenty of water. After a time
you may take away all covering from his cage and let him,
like yourself, enjoy the glories of the sunlight. In a very
short space of time his captivity will cease to be so irksome,
especially if for the first week or two you use him
to only seeing yourself near.</p>

<p>The squirrel, or at least the common red one of our forest,
seems remarkably intelligent, and its humors vary almost
as much in comparison as those of a child. I kept
four, having brought them up from the nest, and their
antics and different moods were a source of continued amusement.
Sometimes Tom would quarrel with a sort of mimic
anger with Jill, and Jim and Sam were almost continually
finding fault with each other over poor unfortunate Lady
Jill, whose chief misfortune seemed to be that she preferred
Tom to either of the others. The affection seemed
to be returned, for if we gave a piece of potato to Tom he
instantly passed it over to Jill and shared it. Sometimes
entire good-humor would prevail, when the gambols with
each other were a very pretty sight. This was generally
on a fine sunny spring morning after a good meal of nuts.
The cage was large, and a sort of leap-frog was kept up
for half an hour, ending by somebody getting Tom’s temper
out over Miss Jill. I never had a bite from either,
and this I attribute to my never handling them unnecessarily,
and never being afraid to take hold of them carefully
but firmly.</p>

<p>Their end was a sad one. I acquired a splendid Persian
cat, and the strangeness of a new habitation made Miss
Pussy very spiteful and bad-tempered. One day I had turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
out the four squirrels in order to clean the cage thoroughly,
and they as usual betook themselves out of the window.
With a sudden bound Puss had poor Jill, and with
one scrunch she was dead. Puss then bounded after the
others, and they escaping up a large yew tree I lost sight of
all but one forever. What ultimately became of Jim and
Sam I never knew, but Tom would often show himself in
the tree and look down with eyes which seemed to say mournfully,
“Ah, you’ve killed my little wife between you, and
I’m not such a coon as to trust myself within range of her
murderers.” Shortly after this we removed, and thus ended
my squirrel-keeping, not, however, without much regret on
my side at least.</p>

<h2><a id="VI_BIRD_TRAPPING">VI.<br /><span class="chapterfont">BIRD TRAPPING.</span></a></h2>


<p>Bird-catching has always a fascination for boys, and, indeed,
in my opinion, as a harmless but most interesting
pastime, it may be compared not unfavorably with fishing.</p>

<p>“But,” I hear some one say, “is it not cruel to catch and
imprison or kill our pretty feathered friends, and if so, is it
not wrong to teach boys cruelty?” I answer emphatically
“No” to the first of these, and that reply does away with
the other question.</p>

<p>It is not cruel to catch the hawk that preys on kindred
species, as does the shark or pike, or the beautiful kingfisher
that ruthlessly slaughters your innocent baby trout, or
the weird and ghostly heron, whose insatiable maw will ever
cry, “Give! Give!” like the daughters of the horseleech,
from every inhabited stream, or the bad-mannered crow, or
the mischievous jay with his egg-eating proclivities.</p>

<p>Then there are some birds, such as pigeons, blackbirds,
thrushes, redwings and plovers, and the water-fowl, such as
moorhens, widgeon, teal, ducks, etc., which are excellent
eating, and who shall say that to kill and eat necessarily
implies cruelty?</p>

<p>“But about the pretty song-birds?” you say. Well, now,
what bird is happier in captivity than your consequential
cock bullfinch, or merry-voiced chaffinch? And are there
more annoying birds in existence to those who live by the
soil? If you doubt me, go and ask the gardener and hear
what he says about Chaffy’s and Bully’s work on the fruitbuds.
Then remember what present pleasure the joyous
song of the well-fed and warmly-caged linnet or siskin gives
to all; but perchance most of all to some one whose hours
are spent wearily on the bed of pain.</p>

<p>Of course, catching birds for the mere sake of doing it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
wrong, and pray is not fishing liable to the same objection?
To go out for the mere purpose of bringing home lots of fish,
which are afterwards put to no use, is an abuse of an otherwise
harmless sport to which such great and good men as
Izaak Walton, Sir Henry Wotton, Archbishop Paley, Charles
Kingsley, Mr. John Bright, and many others, have been and
are devoted.</p>

<p>Besides, the methods I shall explain, except for the larger
birds of prey&mdash;<em>vermin</em>, in fact&mdash;need cause no pain to the
captured bird, or if it does, only of the most instant character,
which is over when the bird is dead or caged. The
wildest birds require only proper treatment to render them
happy in confinement, and of this fact I was never more
forcibly convinced than when, visiting a very experienced
bird-catcher the other day, I saw a huge tabby tom-cat reposing
in the cage of a cock gold-finch, whose sweet song
must have lulled the cat to sleep and a forgetfulness of its
fierce destroying instincts. Hearing it sing, I could not help
recalling Walton’s pious and beautiful reflection anent the
nightingale: “Lord, what music hast Thou provided for Thy
saints in heaven when Thou affordest bad men such music on
earth!”</p>

<p>Finally, in defense of the bird catcher’s art, let me urge the
benefit young people derive from an intimate knowledge of
the natural history of birds and their surroundings. As in
fishing the best naturalist in fish is invariably the best angler,
so whether he be scientific or not, the best ornithologist is,
by virtue of his knowledge, inevitably the most successful
bird-catcher. Nothing can conduce to an unaffected love of
nature&mdash;the “time vesture” of God, Carlyle terms it&mdash;more
readily than close observation of the habits, instincts, and intelligences
of the creatures over which man has been given
dominion.</p>

<p>Birds, the flight of which man, with all his mechanical ingenuity,
had never yet been able to imitate, are of the
most beautiful and wonderful of these, and their capture within
the limits I have laid down is a pastime at once innocent,
amusing, instructive and profitable. One word more. Be
gentle boys, and then presently become gentle<em>men</em> in the true
sense of the word, and handle each captive, if it be alive, mercifully,
“as if you loved him,” inflicting no unnecessary pain
or discomfort in any wise.</p>

<p>Having then in some sort justified bird-catching, if indeed
this was needed, let me say how I intend treating the subject
in the few following chapters. First, with your attention,
I will refer to bird-catching by net; secondly, catching
birds by bird-lime; and thirdly, trapping birds, which latter division
will embrace the various use of the springs, traps, snares,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
gins, etc., in vogue amongst professional trappers, game-keepers
and others. As the directions will be severely practical,
any one will be able to succeed from them&mdash;assuming,
of course, he has the requisite patience. There is one thing,
however, to be borne in mind, that is&mdash;there is a Wild Birds’
Preservation Act, which, inefficient and muddling as it is, is
nevertheless the law of the land, and in it a close time is
provided, during which bird-catching is illegal.</p>

<h2><a id="VII_BIRD-CATCHING_BY_NET">VII.<br /><span class="chapterfont">BIRD-CATCHING BY NET.</span></a></h2>


<p>There are several sorts of nets used for various species of
birds, but for song birds the most common is termed the
clap-net, of
which <a href="#Fig_a1">Fig. 1</a> is
an outline representation.
In
looking carefully
at it you will
see I have left

netting;
this, however,

have a net;
consider, therefore,
the two

to that on which
the net is

<div id="Fig_a1" class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i028.jpg" width="400" height="549" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 1.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now the net
from which the
drawing was
taken was
somewhat different
from the
usual kind.
Those ordinarily
used are of
twine, and netted
diagonally
with mesh three
quarter inches.</p>

<p>This one, however, if of silk undressed fishing line,
and of half-inch mesh, netted with a square mesh instead of
diamond-shape or diagonal. At each end of it are attached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
jointed poles which fit in each other like joints of a fishing-rod;
these are when put together six feet six inches in
length, but the net itself is broader to allow of a certain
amount of bagging.</p>

<p>If this were not so the birds would be liable to run along
underneath the net and escape, whereas as now arranged
they entangle themselves in the soft silk meshes. Of course
silk is not necessary, but it is best if expense is no object. A
twine net will do very well for boys, and if they have mastered
the instructions for netting they
need have no difficulty in making
their own.</p>

<p>The engraving, if carefully looked
into, explains itself, but I will, to further
elucidate the matter, tell you how
it is laid. First, bear in mind the
net in the cut is now placed on the
ground as it should be laid; this is
how to do it. Place both nets spread
out as shown, roughly on the ground
(you can measure their proper relative
distances afterward), and drive in
the farthest peg (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i>, farthest from
bird-catcher), to which is attached
both the “top” and “bottom” line
(see cut). Let this peg be firmly
driven in, for on it the chief strain
falls. Now plant the peg at the end
of the jointed pole farthest from the
bird-catcher (<span class="smcap">E</span>). The pole is linked
to this peg either by means of two
staples or loops of rope attached to
both in such a way as to act as a
hinge. Now stretch the bottom between
the two jointed poles as shown,
driving the peg in firmly as before.
Finally plant the peg <em>nearest</em> <span class="smcap">E</span>, having
stretched the bottom line tightly
throughout.</p>

<p>Measure now a space of width sufficient
to allow the two nets when
drawn over toward each other to fall,
covering their <em>top</em> edges about six inches with each other.
Thus, as in the cut, if the net be six feet six inches broad
you must allow twelve feet six inches between them. Having
done this, fix the other net in a manner precisely similar
to its fellow. C on the engraving, as can be seen, is the
pull-line, and it is joined as is shown to a line stretching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
at right angles between the four top line ends of the jointed
poles. The effect of pulling this is to bring the nets up and
over, both falling in the twelve feet six inches space, and
thus inclosing anything within that space. The birds are
enticed by the cage-birds in the first instance (see cut), and
finally by the play-birds perched on the play-stick (<span class="smcap">B</span>).</p>

<div id="Fig_a2" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i029.jpg" width="600" height="179" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 2.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The play-bird is a bird of the same kind as those sought to
be captured, which is attached by means of miniature harness
(to be presently shown) to the play-stick, and it being
comparatively free it proves very attractive (see <a href="#Fig_a2">Fig. 2</a>). C
is the bird. This stick is of three parts: A, a piece of
wood made like <a href="#Fig_a3">Fig. 3</a>; and <span class="smcap">B</span>, a piece of brass tubing beaten
flat at one
end and placed
on the
stick, which
may be a hazel
or ash
twig. A hole
is punctured
through this tube, and a peg passed through it holds it in
its place, as well as serving as an axle on which its movements
work as prompted by the play-line, which passes also
through <span class="smcap">A</span>, as shown in <a href="#Fig_a2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<div id="Fig_a3" class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" width="400" height="99" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 3.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have said the bird is harnessed and tethered to the stick
at <span class="smcap">C</span> (<a href="#Fig_a2">Fig. 2</a>). This harnessing is perfectly painless to the
little fellow, and consists of a sort of double loop affixed to a
<a id="Ref_6">swivel</a> (<a href="#Fig_a6">Fig. 6</a>). The head of the bird is passed through and
the loops are drawn down over and round its wings close to
the body. Of course they are drawn and tied just tight
enough to fit the body, and the swivel is attached; then a
piece of fine twine of about a foot and a half in length connects
the play-bird with its stick. The method of using this
bird is as follows: Directly the call-birds&mdash;which are cock
birds in full song&mdash;have attracted others of their species, the
bird-catcher gently pulls the play line, raising and lowering
the stick. This prompts the play-bird to use its wings in a
perfectly natural manner, and the consequence is, the wild
birds becoming bolder at seeing one of their brethren so apparently
unrestrained, venture in the forbidden space, and
with no fear visible at once proceed to exchange civilities.
As soon as the bird-catcher observes the bird well in the
reach of the nets, he pulls swiftly and strongly at <span class="smcap">C</span> (<a href="#Fig_a1">Fig. 1</a>),
and the nets close over both the play or decoy bird and those
he has innocently lured to their captivity. Now this in no
case injures them, and running up, the bird-catcher places
them in a large airy cage opening inwards, and commonly
covers them over with a cloth, lest in the first moments of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
restraint they injure themselves against the bars. Two or
more play-birds should be used, so that not one may be over-tired.</p>

<div id="Fig_a6" class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i031.jpg" width="300" height="364" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 6.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Thus you have the whole apparatus of “clap”-netting and
its use explained. Now for a few hints as to where to set a
net. First, do not forget to mark the habits of the birds
yourself, and so learn where to find them at all seasons.
Larks and linnets are easily
found in open plains and by
water brooks, goldfinches
come in autumn to feed off
the thistledown, starling
swarm as winter comes on
and are met with in all sorts
of pastures where some
growth of underwood or
deciduous trees are found.
For shy birds let your full
line be quite forty yards
long; and a good plan for
blackbirds, starlings, and
other wary birds is to lay
your nets and get behind a
hedge or other hiding-place.
A little ingenuity in this way
will often procure a goodly
stroke of success. The other
morning after a frost I caught fourteen blackbirds close to a
long laurel hedge, hiding myself in a large rhododendron.</p>

<p>Sometimes hawks, and even birds of a non-preying but
quite different species to your call-bird, are caught in the
clap-net. The former usually pounces down upon or near
the poor little play-bird, and thus the biter is bitten. “Serve
him right,” say you; so say I. The other birds are probably
only curious to know what it is all about.</p>

<p>This kind of net is the best for amateurs, and I shall
therefore not describe that sort which is used by professionals
for lark and other birds at night time, often, I am sorry
to say, when it is illegal, and when partridges and pheasants
can be taken. Kingfishers may be caught by stretching a
fine net loosely across an archway of a stream on which they
are known to be, and sparrows may be taken in any numbers
from old thatches, barn, rick, etc., at night in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Stretch your net on two cane poles and let two people
carry it upright; another holds a lantern at about the middle
of this net on the outer side from the barn to be “netted.”
Let another, taking a long pole, buffet about the interior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
under the eaves and in the nooks and corners; the
birds will then fly out and make for the light, only to be entangled
in the net. Beating the hedgerows at night will
produce the same effect; and, let me tell you, sparrow pudding
is not to be despised.</p>

<p>Water-birds, such as dabchicks, moorhens, and even ducks,
may be taken by means of nets stretched across ditches and
“drawns” which they frequent. I have especially been successful
with those little nuisances of the fish culturist, the
dabchick, or dapper as they are called in some places, by
means of a common dragnet, which I use for trout catching
in spawning time, but as my readers have already the facilities
I have in this direction, I need not say more about that
style of netting.</p>

<h2><a id="VIII_BIRD-CATCHING_WITH_TRAPS">VIII.<br /><span class="chapterfont">BIRD-CATCHING WITH TRAPS.</span></a></h2>


<p>The word “trap” in the title of this book is intended to
be made use of in a somewhat wide and also narrow sense.
Under it I shall include what would otherwise be called a
snare&mdash;namely, the “springe,” or “springle.” On the other
hand I shall make use of it in what may seem a rather restricted
sense, inasmuch as that I do not intend to tell you
how to catch birds by means of the “gin,” or steel trap.
Mind you, there are some birds&mdash;such as the magpie and
crow&mdash;which it is almost impossible to catch in any other
manner. For them the deadly, pain-dealing “gin” is justifiable.
For the use of boys, I do not, however, recommend
it in bird-catching; it always maims if it does not kill outright,
and thus, should any of you desire to stuff the bird you
have captured, its injured plight is much against its appearance.</p>

<p>The springe, as many of you know, is a horse-hair loop
fixed to some immovable object, such as the branch of a tree,
etc. Mr. Montagu Brown, in his “Practical Taxidermy,”
thus describes the making of it. “Here,” he says, “I have
a black horsehair about two feet long; I double it, holding
it between the right hand finger and thumb, leaving a little
loose loop about half an inch long; from this point I proceed
by an overhand motion of the thumb to twist it up. On
reaching the bottom I make a small knot to prevent it
unrolling, then pushing the knotted end through the eye of
the loop, I thus form a loose noose. I then attach a piece of
wire to the free end by a twisted loop (<a href="#Fig_a7">Fig. 7</a>). With about
half a dozen of these coiled in an oval tin box I am ready
to snare any small bird whose haunt I may discover.”</p>

<div id="Fig_a7" class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i033a.jpg" width="200" height="186" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 7.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This springe is varied in a variety of ways, but it is remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
deadly for nearly all birds. The piece of wire is
of course twisted round a branch or other fixed point, and
the noose, for such it is, is so arranged that the bird pecks
through it, and so gets “haltered.” I always make my
springes of silkworm gut, used in fishing, as being stronger
and practically invisible.</p>

<p>Ducks, moorhens, and dabchicks can be caught with nooses
or springes made of a sufficient number
of hairs or strands of gut, and suspended
to a line fixed across the ditches and
small streams they are known to frequent.
A springe mounted as shown in
<a href="#Fig_a8">Fig. 8</a> (<span class="smcap">A</span> in <a href="#Fig_a9">9</a>) can also be fixed in the
ground, with the noose hanging over the
probable spot of emergence from the
water of either of these birds. Their
exact “run” can easily be determined
by the freshness of the excrement. Snipes are to be taken
by simply attaching the springe to a bullet and burying this
in the soft oose or mud where snipe are known to feed or
run. Plovers can be taken in a similar way.</p>

<div id="Fig_a8" class="figleft" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/i033b.jpg" width="275" height="265" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 8.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the Continent, according to
Mr. Box, the following is the
method of using the springe for
the capture of thrushes and such
birds. The springes being made,
the snarer cuts as many twigs
about eighteen inches in length as
he intends hanging springes.
There are two methods of hanging
them&mdash;in one the twig is bent in
the form of figure 6, the tail end
running through a slit cut in the
upper part of the twig. The other
way is to sharpen a twig at both ends, and insert the
points into a stem of underwood, thus forming a bow, of
which the stem forms the string below the springe, and hanging
from the lower part of the bow is placed a small branch
with three or four berries of the mountain-ash; this is fixed
to the bow by inserting the stalk into a slit in the wood.</p>

<p>The bird-catcher is provided with a basket, one compartment
of which holds his twigs, bent or straight, another his
berries; his springes being already attached to the twigs,
he very rapidly drives his knife into a lateral branch, and
fixes them, taking care that the springe hangs neatly in the
middle of the bow, and that the lower part of the springe is
about three fingers’ breadth from the bottom. By this arrangement
the bird, alighting on the lower side of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
bow, and bending his neck to reach the berries below,
places his head in the noose, finding himself obstructed in
his movements, attempts to fly away, but the treacherous
noose tightens around his neck, and he is found by the
sportsman
hanging by the
neck, a victim of
misplaced confidence.</p>

<div id="Fig_a9" class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i034a.jpg" width="400" height="187" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fig. 9.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another adaptation
of the
springe is shown
at <a href="#Fig_a9">Fig. 9</a>. It
consists of a
wand of hazel,
willow, or any other suitable wood, which is set in the
ground firmly. A short piece of string, hair, or gut connects
it with a cross piece of wood, and to this string also
several (two or more) horse-hair or gut springes are attached,
set in precisely the same manner as shown in <a href="#Fig_a8">Fig. 8</a>.
<span class="smcap">A</span> in <a href="#Fig_a9">Fig. 9</a> is a piece of wood which is so cut as to present
an arm at right angles to the perpendicular. This piece
of wood is driven in the ground and the wand bent over; the
cross-piece is now placed to the edge of the arm of <span class="smcap">A</span>, and
there retained as “ticklishly” as possible.</p>

<p>On this fine setting everything depends. Now get some
short grass and cover up the cross-piece at <span class="smcap">A</span>, so that it cannot
be seen, then arrange your hair springes on the surface,
and strew some crumbs or grains of rice, wheat, etc. The
bird will settle on the cross-piece or on <span class="smcap">A</span>, and peck at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
crumbs, etc., and then will be caught by the legs or head. I
have had excellent results with this.</p>

<p>Another springle shown at <a href="#Fig_a10">Fig. 10</a> is a remarkably good
one for moorhens, or, in fact, any bird having a run, for the
description of which quote
“Practical Trapping,” by Moorman
(though, indeed, I believe
he got his description from
Doucie’s “Rural Sports”).
“The wand, or spring-stick,” he
says, “cross-piece and nooses
as before, but instead of the
simple crutch use a complete
bow with both ends stuck in
the ground. At some distance
from this drive in a straight
piece of stick; next procure a
piece of stick with a complete
fork or crutch at one end. To
set it draw down the spring-stick
and pull the cross-piece
under the bow by the top side
farthest from the spring-stick.
Now hold it firmly with one
hand while you place the forked
stick with its crutch pressing
against the opposite upright
stick and bring its free end
against the lower end of the
cross-piece, and adjust as firmly
as you can. Finally arrange
the nooses in such a manner
that if one of them or the
crutched stick is touched the
latter falls, and releasing the
cross-piece the spring-stick flies
up and the bird with it.” (<span class="smcap">A</span>)
indicates the cross-piece, (<span class="smcap">B</span>)
the forked stick, (<span class="smcap">C</span>) the adjustment.

<p>Yet another of the springle traps which I have seen used
with very great success for the capture of flesh-eating birds
is shown in <a href="#Fig_a11">Fig. 11</a>. A and <span class="smcap">B</span> are two sapling oak or ash-trees,
growing near each other. Two holes are bored in <span class="smcap">A</span>
with a large gimlet; at <span class="smcap">C</span>, in <span class="smcap">B</span>, a wire loop is attached, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the loop <span class="smcap">E</span> is passed through the upper perforation, as
shown. At <span class="smcap">D</span> a piece of cord with a round knot in it is
passed through after <span class="smcap">B</span> is bent toward <span class="smcap">A</span>. F is a piece of
wood, the point of which is shaped like a blunt cone, and
this is sustained on the knot in the position shown by the
spring of <span class="smcap">B</span>, being similar, in fact, to the tongue of a wooden
mole-trap, shown in a previous number. On this piece of
wood is tied a fresh lump of meat, or a pigeon’s egg may be
blown and stuck on. Indeed, any bait may be used, providing
it is not too heavy. The bird, of course, pecks strongly
at it through the loop <span class="smcap">E</span>, and is instantly caught, or if it
attempts to alight, which is often the case, the noose catches
it alive by the legs. My drawing is a rough one, but sufficiently
explains what is meant.</p>

<div id="Fig_a11" class="figleft" style="width: 245px;">

</div>

<p>I have thus given a brief sketch of what boys can do in
bird-catching with no more expense than a few cents&mdash;if we
except the net, and that need not cost much if one is disposed
to make it. There are many other traps which are
variously successful. There is, for example, the trap-cage,
which contains on one side a decoy bird, and a very useful
one it is, and easily procured from a bird-fancier. Then
there is the old sieve and string and brick trap, about which
no boy needs to be told. I have taken twenty and thirty
wild fowl in a night by baiting with pieces of sheep’s lights
or lungs a large eel-hook. Then again for kingfishers there
is a round spring-trap, which catches them by the legs, and
is cruel therefore. Herons may be taken on a baited hook&mdash;the
bait-fish, of course. When all is said and done, however,
for general bird-catching, where sport and not torture
is the means here set forth are decidedly the most satisfactory.</p>

<p>First and foremost, however, if you would be successful,
take this practical counsel to yourself. Study the natures
and habits of the birds; the droppings and footprints will
always indicate a favorite resort. Why, I took a dozen birds
the other day with half a dozen of <a href="#Fig_a9">Figure 9</a> traps in less than
four hours by simply setting and resetting in the right
places, and then retiring out of sight.</p>

<p>And not merely out of sight, let me tell the tyro, but out
of the range of the sense of smell. Never get to windward of
any birds if you are intent on catching them. It is a curious
fact amongst the lower animals, especially those brought
under domestication, that they perceive and appreciate at its
value against themselves the presence of man by smell as
well as sight. Creatures of prey, from the hatred with which
they are held, seem to possess this faculty in the highest
degree. Were it not so, indeed, the struggle for existence
with them would soon end, and many at least of the species<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>&mdash;whether
fish, flesh or fowl&mdash;would become extinct as the
dodo.</p>

<p>The bird-lime itself is the next consideration under this
heading. I do not advise any boy to make it himself, but
if he nevertheless chooses to do so, here is a recipe which will
produce a very good “lime.” Half a pint of Linseed-oil
should be put into an iron pot and carefully boiled over the
fire for four hours, or, in fact, till it thickens sufficiently,
stirring it repeatedly the while with a stick. The oil is
smooth when it boils. In order to ascertain when it is done
take out the stick and immerse it in water, after which see
if it sticks to the fingers. If it does, the oil is ready to be
poured into cold water, and thereafter placed in little flat
tin boxes&mdash;the most convenient receptacles, as they fit in
the waistcoat pocket, and can be used as required.</p>

<p>Birdlime is also made from holly bark, but according to
the directions given in the “Encyclopædia Britannica” the
process is much too troublesome for boys, and as one can
buy birdlime enough to stick a flock of rooks together for a
few pence from a professional bird-catcher, life may be considered
too short for that process at this time. As I am some
distance from a town, much less a professional bird-catcher,
I make mine as above, and find it little if any inferior to that
I have been in the habit of buying.</p>

<p>During winter time, when frost and snow cover the earth,
birdlime is very useful, for at that time the “clap” net is of
very little use. A good plan then is to sweep a bare place
anywhere near a plantation or wooded garden, or even in the
farm-yards, and having anointed a few dozen wheat ears with
the straw attached&mdash;or rather, having anointed the straw for
about a foot nearest the ear&mdash;to spread them about in the
patch. The birds will attempt to take the ears away, and
will so get limed and drop to the ground. You must very
quickly pick them up or you will lose some, as their struggles
not infrequently release them, at least partially, and they
flutter out of reach.</p>

<p>Sometimes it will be found that a few handfuls of oats,
barley or wheat thrown down where the limed straws are
will be of service when they do not seem to care for the wheat
ears themselves. There is the probability of the little fellows
coming in contact with the ears, and so getting limed.
These methods are chiefly applicable, as I have said, to cold
weather.</p>

<p>A different mode of procedure may be practiced when the
weather is very hot. Cut, say, a hundred twigs of some
smooth, thin wood, such as withy, and after liming, stick
them down by the side of any rivulet of water near woody
growths, and of course not near a large tract of water such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
as a lake or river. Cover over the stream with brush or fern,
so that the birds can come only by where your limed twigs
are placed. I have had remarkable sport in this way when
the birds have been coming to drink during the forenoon
and afternoon.</p>

<p>I tried an experiment for rooks with bird-lime some little
time ago. We all know that in winter, during a thaw, rooks
will frequent pastures in great numbers, especially if cattle
be present. About fifty yards to the west of where I am now
sitting is a long waterside pasture, and thousands of rooks
could be seen digging right lustily. Rooks are too strong
and wily to be limed in the usual way with bristles or twigs,
so I made some paper cones&mdash;funnel-shaped, you know, like
the grocers use for packing sugar&mdash;and anointed the inside
with bird-lime, sticking also a few grains of wheat round the
inner side. The result was ridiculous in the extreme. After
scattering a few grains of corn about and placing about a
dozen of these limed brown-paper funnels in a likely manner,
I retired to a distance, and with my field-glass watched. A
flock soon found out the scattered grain, and one after the
other the cones were inspected, but for some time no one
ventured to do more. Presently, however, after the loose
grain was apparently all eaten, one of the wily birds had the
temerity to poke his head inside a cone. The result was
much to his evident surprise, for the cone stuck tight, and
there he was tumbling and attempting to fly with a foolscap
on which blindfolded him, and which stuck tight enough to
allow me time to go up and release the poor fellow. I did
not kill him, for old rook pie is by no means palatable. I
tried this plan for a heron which continually frequented a
little pond wherein my last year’s trout are kept, but did not
succeed in capturing him, though he took both the cone and
fish used for a bait away somehow. Anyhow it has most
thoroughly frightened my gentleman, for I have not seen
him since.</p>

<p>One fine morning some time since I had a delightful ramble
with a quaint old character living hereabouts who gets
his living by mole and bird catching. Old “Twiddle” he is
familiarly called. One faculty he has, and that is a natural
love for nature’s works and a gift of observation which has,
perhaps almost unknown to himself, forced him into being a
natural naturalist, if I may so use the expression. He can
tell any bird on the wing by its flight, he knows all the
fancies&mdash;some of them old, imagined fancies&mdash;of bees, each
fly as it flits from the water’s edge has a name, though far
from being that given it by science. No matter for that; a
rose by any other name would smell as sweet and old Twiddle
can tell something of its life-history. Well, Twiddle and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I started on our ramble, and this was how he was equipped.
A cage containing a beautiful little cock gold-finch duly and
comfortably furnished with food and water, and protected
from the sharp though clear air of the bright November day
by means of an old silk handkerchief. Some dozen or two
of prepared bristles, a small box of birdlime, and a “dummy”
or stuffed gold-finch set up on a branch of wood with
one end sharpened so that the latter could be stuck in the
ground and then the bird retained in any position deemed
desirable. The bristles were of the best shoemaker’s kind,
and, were arranged in bunches of three on a stout carpet-needle.</p>

<p>By the by I have improved on these by substituting a fish-hook
straightened (see <a id="Ref_6a">Fig. 6</a>). To do this take an ordinary
eel-hook and make it red-hot in the gas or candle flame,
holding it the while by means of a pair of pliers. It can be
readily straightened after this, whether hot or cold, as the
heating softens the wire. The utility of the barb lies in the
fact that the bird cannot by any chance fly away with the
bristle or lose it for you in its struggles, because of the
barb’s holding power when thrust into the branch of a tree,
etc.</p>

<p>But to return. Chatting about this and that we journeyed
along till after old Twiddle had craned his neck over a ledge
to regard the other side of a field he announced our walk for
the present ended. On creeping through a hole in the hedge
this field turned out to be a piece of evidently waste water
meadow, so-called because the crops are, as it were, manured
with water from the neighboring river, and a perfect little
forest of thistles with their downy heads swaying in the
breeze indicated the probable presence of the goldfinch.
Some thorn-trees grew in a row down the center of the field,
and hither and thither the sparrows flitted amongst their
branches busily chattering the news of sparrowdom. But I
saw no finches. “Twiddle,” said I, “where are the goldfinches?”
“Ye’ll see where they be, sir, presently,” he answered,
setting down the caged bird near the largest of the
thorns. “Now, Billy,” he added, speaking to the bird, “crow
away,” and with that he removed the handkerchief. Billy
needed no second bidding, and his little throat quivered and
trembled with the glad song which came thrilling forth.</p>

<p>Twiddle now placed the dummy bird just beneath a branch
of the thorn close to the cage and so as to be easily seen,
and all around it and round the cage the bristles carefully
limed were stuck. All was now ready. We retired behind
the hedge where we could see and not be seen.</p>

<p>Presently the singing was answered and we saw a gold-finch
hopping about amongst the branches of the thorn.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Suddenly it caught sight of the dummy bird and with a
pleased swiftness flew towards it. In another second it had
touched a limed bristle and was rolling over and over hopelessly
liming its wings with every fresh bristle it touched.</p>

<p>Very carefully the little chap was dusted with a little fine
earth to mitigate the stickiness and placed in another cage
which the bird-catcher always carries for the wild birds. It
is flat and long and well supplied with food and water; in
the upper part of it is a hole sufficiently large to admit the
hand, and to the two edges of this hole is tacked the leg of
an old stocking, which falls inwards. Then the bird can
easily be placed inside, but cannot escape, because the folds
of the stocking fold together.</p>

<p>We caught five there and, as the market value of the birds
was about twenty-five cents, Twiddle, it must be owned, had
a very profitable morning’s work. Let me express a hope
that my readers may be so successful.</p>

<h2><a id="The_Art_of_Stretching_and_Curing_Skins">The Art of Stretching and Curing Skins.</a></h2>


<p>The market value of skins are greatly affected by the care
used in skinning and curing. We take the following from
The Trapper’s Guide, the best known authority on these
matters:</p>

<p>In drying skins it is important that they should be stretched
tight like a strained drum head. This can be done after
a fashion by simply nailing them flat on a wide board or a
barn door. But this method, besides being impracticable on
a large scale in the woods (where most skins have to be
cured) is objectionable, because it exposes only one side of
the pelt to the air. The stretchers that are generally approved
and used by good trappers, are of three kinds, adapted
to the skins of different classes of animals, and shall call
them the board-stretcher, the bow-stretcher, and the hoop-stretcher,
and will describe them, indicating the different
animals to which each is adapted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Board-Stretcher.</span>&mdash;This contrivance is made in the
following manner: Prepare a board of bass-wood or other
light material, two feet three inches long, three inches and a
half wide at one end, and two inches and an eighth at the
other, and three-eighths of an inch thick. Chamfer it from the
center to the sides almost to an edge. Round and chamfer the
small end about an inch up on the sides. Split this board
through the center with a knife or saw. Finally, prepare a
wedge of the same length and thickness, one inch wide at
the large end, and tapering to three-eighths of an inch at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
small end, to be driven between the halves of the board.
This is a stretcher suitable for a mink or a marten. Two
larger sizes, with similar proportions, are required for the
larger animals. The largest size, suitable for the full grown
otter or wolf, should be five feet and a half long, seven
inches wide at the large end when fully spread by the wedge,
and six inches at the small end. An intermediate size is required
for the fisher, raccoon, fox, and some other animals,
the proportions of which can be easily figured out.</p>

<p>These stretchers require that the skin of the animal should
not be ripped through the belly, but should be stripped off
whole. This is done in the following manner: Commence
with the knife at the hind feet, and slit down to the vent.
Cut around the vent, and strip the skin from the bone of the
tail with the help of the thumb nail or a split slick. Make no
other slits in the skin, except in the case of the otter, whose
tail requires to be split, spread, and tacked on to the board.
Peel the skin from the body by drawing it over itself, leaving
the fur side inward.</p>

<p>In this condition the skin should be drawn on to the split
board, (with the back on one side and the belly on the other)
to its utmost length, and fastened with tacks or by notches
cut in the edge of the board, and then the wedge should be
driven between the two halves. Finally, make all fast by a
tack at the root of the tail, and another on the opposite side.
The skin is then stretched to its utmost capacity, as a boot-leg
is stretched by the shoe-maker’s “tree,” and it may be
hung away in the proper place, by a hole in one end of the
stretcher, and left to dry.</p>

<p>A modification of this kind of stretcher, often used in curing
the skins of the muskrat and other small animals, is a
simple board, without split or wedge, three-sixteenths of an
inch thick, twenty inches long, six inches wide at the large
end, and tapering to five and a half inches at six inches from
the small end, chamfered and rounded as in the other cases.
The animal should be skinned as before directed, and the
skin drawn tightly on to the board and fastened with about
four tacks. Sets of these boards, sufficient for a muskrat
campaign, can easily be made and transported. They are
very light and take up but little room in packing, thirty-two
of them making but six inches in thickness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Bow Stretcher.</span>&mdash;The most common way of treating
the muskrat is to cut off its feet with a hatchet, and rip with
a knife from between the two teeth in the lower jaw, down
the belly, about two inches below where the fore-legs come
out. Then the skin is started by cutting around the lips,
eyes, and ears, and is stripped over the body with the fur
side inward. Finally a stick of birch, water-beech, ironwood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hickory, or elm, an inch in diameter at the butt, and
three feet and a half long, is bent into the shape of an oxbow
and shoved into the skin, which is drawn tight, and
fastened by splitting down a sliver in the bow and drawing
the skin of the lip into it.</p>

<p>This method is too common to be easily abolished, and is
tolerable when circumstances make it necessary; but the
former method of stretching by a tapering board, in the case
of muskrats as well as other small animals, is much the
best. Skins treated in that way keep their proper shape, and
pack better than those stretched on bows, and in the long
run boards are more economical than bows, as a set of them
can be used many times, and will last several years, whereas
bows are seldom used more than once, being generally broken
in taking out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Hoop Stretcher.</span>&mdash;The skins of large animals, such
as the beaver and the bear, are best dried by spreading
them, at full size, in a hoop. For this purpose, a stick of
hickory or other flexible wood should be cut, long enough to
entirely surround the skin when bent. (If a single stick long
enough is not at hand, two smaller ones can be spliced together.)
The ends should be brought around, lapped, and
tied with a string or a withe of bark. The skin should be
taken from the animal by ripping from the lower front teeth
to the vent, and peeling around the lips, eyes, and ears, but
without ripping up the legs. It should then be placed inside
the hoop and fastened at opposite sides, with twine or
bark, till all loose parts are taken up, and the whole
stretched so that it is nearly round and as tight as a drum-head.
When it is dry it may be taken from the hoop, and is
ready for packing and transportation.</p>

<p>This is the proper method of treating the skin of the deer.
Some prefer it for the wolf and raccoon. In many cases the
trapper may take his choice between the hoop and the board
method. One or the other methods will be found satisfactory
for curing all kinds of skins.</p>

<h2><a id="Dressing_and_Tanning_Skins_and_Furs">Dressing and Tanning Skins and Furs.</a></h2>


<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dressing Skins with Fur Wool on.</span>&mdash;The cheapest and
readiest as well as the best method of dressing skins for use
with the hair or wool on, is to first scrape off all the fat with
a knife rather blunt on the edge, so as not to cut holes into
the hide, upon a round smooth log. The log for convenience
sake should have a couple of legs in one end, like a tressle;
the other end should rest upon the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>After the fat is well cleaned off, take the brains of the animal,
or the brains of any other recently killed, and work them
thoroughly into the hide. This renders the hide pliable. Then
to preserve from the ravages of insects scatter on it some
powdered alum and a little saltpeter. If the hair side has become
greasy, a little weak lye will take it out. Sheep-skins
may be dressed in the same way, though the wool should be
cleaned with soapsuds before using the brains. Another way,
but more expensive, is to use a paste made of the yolk of eggs
and whiting instead of brains, working it in the same way,
letting it dry and brushing off the whiting. Then add the
powdered alum as before. Deer-skins and even small calf-skins
are often tawed as the process is called with the hair
on for garments. If it is desired to give the deer-skin a yellow
color, yellow ocher or chrome yellow may be used in combination
with the brains or yolks of eggs and afterwards
brushed off.</p>

<p>If it is simply desired to preserve skins until they are sold,
it is only necessary to dry them thoroughly. If the weather
should be damp and warm, salt the flesh side slightly with
fine salt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Without the Wool or Hair.</span>&mdash;Sheep-skin, deer-skin, dog-skin,
calf-skin, &amp;c., for gloves, &amp;c., are also tawed, but the
hair must be taken off. The skins are first soaked in warm
water, scraped on the flesh side to get off fat, and hung in a
warm room until they begin to give a slight smell of hartshorn.
The wool or fur then comes off rapidly. The hair side
should now be thoroughly scraped against the hair. The skin
is next soaked two or three weeks in weak lime water,
changing the water two or three times. Then they are brought
out again, scraped smooth and trimmed. Then rinsed in clean
water, then soaked in wheat bran and water for two or three
weeks. After this they are well stirred around in pickle of
alum, salt and water. Then they are thrown again into the
bran and water for two or three days. Then stretched and
dried somewhat in a warm room. After this they are soaked
in warm water and then worked or trodden on in a trough or
pail filled with yolk of eggs, salt, alum, flour and water,
beaten to a froth. They are finally stretched and dried in an
airy room, and last of all smoothed with a warm smoothing
iron. This makes the beautiful leather we see in gloves,
military trimmings, &amp;c. The proportions for the egg paste
are as follows: <span class="nowrap">3 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> pounds salt, 8 pounds alum, 21 pounds
wheat flour and yolks of nine dozen eggs. Make a paste
with water, dissolving first the alum and salt. A little of
this paste is used as wanted with a great deal of water.</p>

<p>Chamois skin and deer skins not wanted for gloves are
similarly treated up to the point of treating with egg paste.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Instead of using this process, they are oiled on the hair side
with very clean animal oil, rolled into balls and thrown into
the trough of a fulling mill, well beaten two or three hours,
aired, re-oiled, beaten again and the process repeated a third
time. They are then put into a warm room until they begin
to give out a decided smell, then scoured in weak lye to take
out superfluous grease. Here the intention is merely to get
a thick felt-like skin of good color, a nicely grained surface
is not required as in gloves. The skins are finally rinsed,
wrung out, stretched and dried, and when nearly dry, slightly
rub with a smooth, hard, round stick.</p>

<p>These are the fine processes. A dried skin oiled so as to
become smooth and pliable will retain the hair or wool a considerable
time.</p>

<p>Or it may be made more durable where the color of the
flesh side is no object by scraping, washing in soapsuds and
then putting directly into the tan pit. For ordinary purposes
rabbit, squirrel and other small skins can be efficiently
preserved with the hair by the application of powdered alum
and fine salt, put on them when fresh, or if not fresh by
dampening them first. Squirrel skins when wanted without
the hair will tan very well in wheat bran tea, the fat and
hair having been previously removed by soaking in lime-water
and scraping. Old tea leaves afford tannin enough
for small skins, but they give a color not nearly so pleasant
as bran. Almost any of the barks afford tannin enough for
small skins&mdash;willow, pine, poplar, hemlock of course, sumach,
etc.</p>

<h2><a id="Coloring_or_Dyeing_Skins_and_Furs">Coloring or Dyeing Skins and Furs.</a></h2>


<p>Furs are dyed by dealers, to suit some fashion, to conceal
defects or to pass off inferior furs for better ones.</p>

<p>The best way is to brush the dye over the fur with a good
sponge, brushing with the hair. As a matter of course, you
can only dye them of a darker color than they are, and retain
the handsome lustrous look peculiar to fur. They may
be bleached, but the process leaves the fur looking like
coarse flax or even hemp.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Blue.</span>&mdash;Sulphate of indigo, (soluble indigo, sold by all
druggists,) is the readiest and best to get a blue with. Furs
are never dyed blue for sale, for that would be spoiling a
white fur, but sheep-skins are. The skin should be dipped
several times in a bath of hot alum water, allowed to drain,
and then dipped into a solution of sulphate of indigo and
water, with a few drops of sulphuric acid added, this gives a
pale blue. Aniline blue is very fine, and dyeing with it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
very simple. A solution of the color in water is made, a
hot solution, and the skin put in all at once, (if a part of the
skin is put in first that part will be darkest, so quick is the
absorption of these colors). Fancy sheep-skin mats are
colored blue, red, green, and yellow, and have a ready sale
when they are new.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Black.</span>&mdash;The best black is obtained by first dyeing the
skin a blue. Then boil one-quarter pound gall nuts, powdered,
and one and one-quarter ounces of logwood, in three
gallons of water. If the flesh side is to be blue, while the
fur or wool is another, this decoction must be sponged on.</p>

<p>Get the wool or hair thoroughly impregnated with this
and then add one-quarter pound copperas to the dye and go
over the fur or wool many times with the sponge. The
process above given will answer without previous blueing,
but the black is not so brilliant. Another “home-made”
dye which will answer for dyeing clothes a black, as well as
sheep-skins, is this: Just make a bath of eight ounces of bichromate
of potash, six ounces alum, four ounces fustic;
boil in water enough to cover five pounds of yarn, cloth or
a single sheep-skin. Make another bath of four pounds of
logwood, four ounces each bar wood and fustic, or eight ounces
fustic; same amount of boiling water as last. Stir the goods
well around in the first bath, keeping the water hot for an
hour; then work it in the second bath the same length of
time. Take them and wring them; then, adding one-quarter
pound of copperas to the last bath, put the goods in again
and give them a good stirring. This is a good black dye
for wool goods or furs, but not for silks or cottons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Red.</span>&mdash;Furs of course are never dyed red, at least in this
country. Sheep-skins might be dyed with madder or cochineal,
but in the former case, the skin would of necessity
be boiled with the dye, as that is necessary in using madder.
Cochineal would be expensive and require much working,
while as brilliant reds and purples may be got from the aniline
colors, dissolved in moderately warm water, the skum
taken off, and skin dipped. These colors are the cheapest,
too, as they go very far. But always have the wool as free
from grease as possible by working in weak hot lye or hot
soapsuds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Yellow.</span>&mdash;Can be got on sheep-skins with black oak bark,
(quercitron bark) old fustic, annotta, and Persian (also called
French) berries. The skin should be previously dipped
into a hot bath of alum, cream of tartar or spirit of tin, about
two ounces to the gallon. About one-half pound of annotta,
or a pound of the other articles, are enough for a single skin.
If you wish to use fustic, be particular to ask for old fustic,
as what is known in the trade as young fustic, is a different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
article and gives a different color. There is also now an
aniline yellow which works like the other colors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Green.</span>&mdash;Dye first blue as explained above, then pass
through a yellow dye, until you get the shade required. An
alum bath, cream of tartar, or spirits of tin, as above, must
be used before the blue is given.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Preservation of Furs.</span>&mdash;While in use furs should be occasionally
combed. When not wanted, dry them first, then let
them cool, and mix among them bitter apples from the druggists,
in small muslin bags, sewing them in several folds of linen,
carefully turned in at the edges and kept from damp. Camphor
or pepper used in the same manner, will have a similar
effect. Well cleaned furs are much less liable to be attacked
by moths, than those affording rich repasts of dried
flesh, though no furs are absolutely safe without great watchfulness.
Wrapping well in good brown paper and keeping
in a tight paper box, are all helps to the preservation of furs.
Sunshine and fresh air kill the fur and wool moth grub.
Therefore taking out the furs occasionally and airing, sunning
and beating them is necessary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">To Tan Muskrat Skins With the Fur On.</span>&mdash;First for
soaking, to 10 gallons of cold soft water add 8 parts of wheat
bran, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> pint of old soap, 1 ounce of borax; by adding 2
ounces of sulphuric acid, the soaking may be done in one-half
the time. If the hides have not been salted, add a pint
of salt. Green hides should not be soaked more than 8
or 10 hours. Dry ones should soak till very soft.</p>

<p>For tan liquor, to ten gallons warm soft water add <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>
bushel bran; stir well and let stand in a warm room till it
ferments. Then add slowly <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> pounds sulphuric acid; stir
all the while. Muskrat hides should remain in about 4 hours.
Then take out and rub with a fleshing knife&mdash;an old chopping
knife with the edge taken off will do. Then work it
over a beam until entirely dry.</p>

<h2><a id="Some_Additional_Valuable_Miscellaneous_Information">Some Additional Valuable Miscellaneous Information
Useful Alike to the Hunter,
Trapper and Angler.</a></h2>


<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Hints to Trappers.</span>&mdash;The skins of animals trapped are
always valued higher than those shot, as shot not only make
holes, but frequently plow along the skin, making furrows,
as well as shaving off the fur. To realize the utmost for
skins they must be taken care of, and also cleaned and prepared
properly. Newhouse gives these general rules derived
from experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Be careful to visit your traps often enough, so that the
skin will not have time to get tainted.</p>

<p>2. As soon as possible after the animal is dead and dry,
attend to the skinning and curing.</p>

<p>3. Scrape off all superfluous flesh and fat, and be careful
not to go so deep as to cut the fiber of the skin.</p>

<p>4. Never dry a skin by the fire or in the sun, but in a cool,
shady place, sheltered from rain. If you use a barn door for
a stretcher (as boys sometimes do), nail the skin on the inside
of the door.</p>

<p>5. Never use preparations of any kind in curing skins, nor
even wash them in water, but simply stretch and dry them as
they are taken from the animal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">To Dress Beaver Skins.</span>&mdash;You must rip the skin the same
as you would a sheep. Stretch it in all ways as much as possible;
then it is to be dressed with equal parts of rock salt
and alum dissolved in water, and made about as thick as
cream, by stirring in coarse flour. This should be spread on
nearly half an inch thick, and scraped off when dry, and repeated
if one time is not enough. This same process of dressing
applies likewise to otter skins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">To Trap Quail.</span>&mdash;A quail trap may be any kind of coop,
supported by a figure 4. The spindle of the figure must
either be so made as to hold grain, or, what is better, some
grains of wheat or buckwheat are strung over a strong
thread with the aid of a needle, and tied to the spindle.
Quails and prairie hens easily enter a trap when the ground
is covered with snow. At other times it is rather difficult
to catch them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">To Trap Wild Turkey.</span>&mdash;A wild turkey trap is made by
first digging a ditch; then over one end is built a rude structure
of logs, covered at the top.</p>

<p>The structure should not be tight, but, of course, sufficiently
close not to let the birds through. Indian corn is
scattered about and in the ditch, and inside of the pen. The
turkeys follow up corn in the ditch, and emerge from it on
the inside. Once there, the silly birds never think of descending
into the ditch, but walk round and round the pen,
looking through the chinks of the logs for escape that way.
To make all sure, the ditch should end about the centre of
the pen, and a bridge of sticks, grass and earth should be
built over the ditch, just inside of the pen, and close to the
logs; otherwise, in going around the bird might step inside
the ditch, and once there, it would follow the light and thereby
reach the outside of the pen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">To Catch Muskrats Without Traps.</span>&mdash;It is a mystery to
many how muskrats, beavers, and other animals, are able to
remain so long under water, apparently without breathing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
especially in winter. The way they manage is, they take in a
good breath at starting, and then remain under water as long
as possible. Then they rise up to the ice and breathe out the
air in their lungs, which remains in a bubble against the
lower part of the ice.</p>

<p>The water near the ice is highly charged with oxygen,
which it readily imparts to the air breathed out. After a
time, this air is taken back in the lungs, and the animal
again goes under the water, repeating this process from time
to time. In this way they can travel almost any distance,
and live almost any length of time under the ice. The hunter
takes advantage of this habit of the muskrat in the following
manner. When the marshes and ponds where the muskrat
abounds are first frozen over, and the ice is thin and clear,
on striking into their houses with his hatchet, for the purpose
of setting his trap, he frequently sees a whole family
plunge into the water and swim away under the ice. Following
one for some distance, he sees him come up to recover
his breath, in the manner above described. After the animal
has breathed against the ice, and before he has time to take
his bubble in again, the hunter strikes with his hatchet directly
over him, and drives him away from his breath. In this
case he drowns in swimming a few rods, and the hunter, cutting
a hole in the ice, takes him out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Bleaching Wool on Tanned Pelts.</span>&mdash;Put an old pot or
other iron vessel in the bottom of a hogshead, and in the
vessel a roll of brimstone. Fasten near the top a stick or
two to place the skin on. The wool must be wet when hung
on the sticks. Heat an old iron red hot, or take live coals
to start the brimstone. When it is burning briskly, cover
the hogshead tight to keep the smoke in. If not white
enough, repeat the process.</p>

<p>The Esquimaux mode of tanning is very simple, and the
material employed the cheapest and cost accessible of any
used in the art, viz: the urine of man and beast. The skins
are prepared in the fur, and softened and tanned in urine,
which is usually kept in tubs in the porches of their huts,
for use in dressing deer, seal and other skins. They show
great skill in the preparation of whale, seal and deer skins,
and these, on the whole, are equal to the best oil skins made
in England. It imparts to them firmness and durability, and
makes them waterproof. The boots worn by the Esquimaux
are generally made from seal or walrus hides, and resist
the encroachments of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hawk and Owl Traps.</span>&mdash;To catch hawks or owls, take a
pole 20 feet long, to be set a short distance from the house
or barn or on the poultry house. Split the top so as to admit
the base of a common steel trap, which should be made fast.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
When both trap and pole are set you may be sure of game of
some kind. These birds naturally light on high objects, such
as dead branches of trees or tops of stacks, and one should
use judgment about the place where he puts the traps. An
open field near the chicken yard is probably the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domestic Manufacture of Furs.</span>&mdash;The skins of raccoons,
minks, muskrats, rabbits, foxes, deer, cats, dogs, woodchucks
and skunks are all valuable. Handsome robes may be made
from the skins of the last two animals, and the writer has
seen fur coats made from the skins of woodchucks, well tanned,
dyed and trimmed, which were elegant as well as comfortable,
and no one but a connoisseur would be able to guess
their origin. Of the finer and nicer furs, beautiful collars,
muffs, cuffs, caps, gloves and trimmings may be made with
a little ingenuity and perseverance; and who would not feel
a greater satisfaction in wearing a nice article, from the fact
that it was something of their own manufacture&mdash;a product
of their own taste and genius?</p>

<p>Very handsome floor-mats are made by tanning sheep
pelts and dyeing them some bright color, which is done with
very little trouble; the art of dyeing is now so familiar to
almost every household. Furs may be dyed as easily as
woolen goods, notwithstanding the impression that it is an
art known only to the trade. Any dye that will color woolens
will also dye furs, only care must be taken not to have
the dye too hot, or the texture of the skin will be injured.</p>

<p>The mode of tanning usually followed by city furriers is to
rub the skins well with rancid butter, then tread them thoroughly
in a tub or vat, after which a large quantity of sawdust
is mixed with them, and the process of treading continued
until all the grease is absorbed, when they are finished
off by beating, working and rubbing with chalk and potter’s
clay, whipping and brushing. An old trapper practiced this
method with small skins, first washing with a suds of soap
and sal-soda to free them from grease, then rinsing in clear
water to cleanse them from the suds, then rubbing as dry as
possible, after which they were put in a mixture of two
ounces of salt to a quart of water, added to three quarts of
milk or bran-water containing one ounce of best sulphuric
acid, and stirred briskly for forty or fifty minutes; from this
they are taken dripping into a strong solution of sal-soda
and stirred till they will no longer foam; they are then hung
to dry, when they are very soft and pliable.</p>

<p>A very good and simple process in use among farmers is
to sprinkle the flesh side, after scraping it well, with equal
parts of pulverized alum and salt, or washing it well with a
strong solution of the same, then folding the flesh side together
and rolling it compactly, in which state it should remain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
for eight or ten days; then it is opened, sprinkled with
bran or sawdust to absorb the moisture, and rolled up again,
and after remaining twenty-four hours, the process is completed
by a thorough rubbing and manipulation, on which the
pliability depends. Skins, when taken off, should be freed
from grease or flesh by thorough scraping, when they may be
dried, and left to await the leisure of the owner. Previous
to tanning they must be well soaked and wrung dry.</p>

<p>It is no extravagance to assert that every farmer’s family
may furnish their own fur collars, gloves, robes, and other
articles of dress and ornament, with trifling expense, from
the resources within their own reach; but from want of more
knowledge on the subject valuable skins are wasted or disposed
of for a mere fraction of their real value, and articles
of apparel that should be made from them are bought at extravagant
prices of fur dealers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian Mode of Tanning Buffalo Skins.</span>&mdash;The hard and
incessant labor that is necessary to properly “Indian tan”
a robe is not easily to realize unless one may see the work go
on day by day from the first step, which is to spread out the
pelt or undressed hide upon the ground, where it is pinned
fast by means of wooden pins driven through little cuts in
the edge of the robe into the earth. The flesh side of the
robe, being uppermost, is then worked over by two and
sometimes three squaws. The tools used are very rude, some
being simply provided with sharp stones or buffalo bones.
Others, more wealthy, have a something that much resembles
a drawing-knife or shave of the cooper. The work in
hand is to free the hide from every particle of flesh, and to
reduce the thickness of the robe nearly one half, and sometimes
even more.</p>

<p>This fleshing, as it is termed, having been thoroughly accomplished,
the hide is thoroughly moistened with water in
which the buffalo brains have been steeped. For ten days
the hide is kept damp with this brain water. Once each day
the hide is taken up and every portion of it rubbed and re-rubbed
by the squaws, who do not have recourse to anything
like a rubbing-board, but use their hands until it would seem
as if the skin would soon be worn off. There seems to be
no definite rule as to the length of time which the robe shall
occupy in curing. The squaw labors until the hide becomes
a robe, which may require the work of one week or two,
sometimes even more; but I think that ten days may be considered
as the average time which it takes to properly cure a
robe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Dress Deer Skins.</span>&mdash;Put the skin into the liquid while
warm, viz: eight quarts rain water to one pint soft soap.
Warm it. Then punch the hide, or work it with a soft stick,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and let it lay one day. It is then to be taken out and wrung&mdash;rolled
between two logs&mdash;or even a wringing machine will
be better. Then stretch it until it is dry, in the sun is best,
or by a hot fire. Then oil it thoroughly with any oil convenient.</p>

<p>It should then be treated to the same bath of suds (heated
quite warm), and lay another day. Then pull it out and dry
as before. Any oil will do, but good fresh butter is better
than anything else. When the skin is dry rub it with ochre,
which will give it a splendid yellow color.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Tanning and Buffing for Deer Skin Gloves.</span>&mdash;For
each skin take a bucket of water and put into it 1 quart of
lime; let the skin or skins lay in from 3 to 4 days; then
rinse in clean water, hair and grain; then soak them in cold
water to get out the glue; now scour or pound in good soap
suds for half an hour; after which take white vitriol, alum
and salt, one tablespoon of each to a skin; this will be dissolved
in sufficient water to cover the skin and remain in it
for 24 hours; wring out as dry as convenient, and spread on
with a brush <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> pint of currier’s oil, and hang in the sun
about two days; after which you will scour out the oil
with soap suds, and hang out again until perfectly dry;
then pull and work them until they are soft; and if a reasonable
time does not make them soft, scour out in suds
again as before, until complete.</p>

<p>The oil may be saved by pouring or taking it from the top
of the suds, if left standing a short time. The buff color is
given by spreading yellow ochre evenly over the surface of
the skin, when finished, rubbing it in well with a brush.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dyeing for Buckskin</span>, (Buff.)&mdash;5 parts of whiting to 2
parts of ochre (yellow), and mix them with water to a paste;
make into cakes and dry. When a dressed skin is dry, rub
one of the balls over the surface; rub the powder in. Take
a piece of sand-paper and raise a nap on the leather by going
over it. (Black.)&mdash;Take clear logwood; after it is dry use
copperas water to blacken it. Be careful and not use too
much. (Dark Brown.)&mdash;5 pounds of oak bark; 4 pounds
of fustic; 14 ounces of logwood. Use alum water (strong)
to make it strike in. (Drab.)&mdash;Mix blue clay with soft soap;
add blue vitriol to shade the color. It can be made any shade
you wish.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dyeing for Morocco and Sheep Leather.</span>&mdash;The following
colors may be imparted to leather, according to the various
uses for which it is intended. (Blue.)&mdash;Blue is given by
steeping the subject a day in urine and indigo, then boiling
it with alum; or it may be given by tempering the indigo
with red wine, and washing the skins therewith.</p>

<p>(Another.)&mdash;Boil elderberries or dwarf elder, then smear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and wash the skins therewith and wring them out; then boil
the elderberries as before in a solution of alum water, and
wet the skins in the same manner once or twice; dry them,
and they will be very blue. (Red.)&mdash;Red is given by washing
the skin and laying them two hours in galls, then wringing
them out, dipping them in a liquor made with ligustrum,
alum and verdigris; in water, and lastly in a dye made of
Brazil wood boiled with lye. (Purple.)&mdash;Purple is given by
wetting the skins with a solution of roche alum in warm
water, and when dry, again rubbing them with the hand
with a decoction of logwood in cold water. (Green.)&mdash;Green
is given by smearing the skin with sap green and alum
water, boiled. (Dark Green.)&mdash;Dark green is given with
steel filings and sal ammoniac, steeped in urine till soft,
then smeared over the skin, which is to be dried in the shade.
(Yellow.)&mdash;Yellow is given by smearing the skin over with
aloes and linseed oil, dissolved and strained, or by infusing
it in weld. (Light Orange.)&mdash;Orange color is given by
smearing it with fustic berries boiled in alum water, or, for
a deep orange, with turmeric. (Sky color.)&mdash;Sky color is
given with indigo steeped in boiling water, and the next
morning warmed and smeared over the skin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Operation of Tanning.</span>&mdash;The first operation is to soak the
hide, as no hide can be properly tanned unless it has been
soaked and broken on a fleshing beam. If the hide has not
been salted add a little salt and soak it in soft water. In
order to be thoroughly soaked, green hides should remain in
this liquor from 9 to 12 days; of coarse the lime varies with
the thickness of the hide. The following liquor is used to
remove hair or wool, viz: 10 gallons cold water (soft), 8
quarts slacked lime, and same quantity of wood ashes. Soak
until the hair or wool will pull off easily.</p>

<p>As it frequently happens it is desirable to cure the hide
and keep the hair clean, the following paste should be made,
viz: equal parts of lime and hard-wood ashes, (lime should
be slacked,) and made into a paste with soft water. This
should be spread on the flesh side of the hide and the skin
rolled up, flesh side in, and placed in a tub, just covering it
with water. It should remain 10 days, or until the hair will
pull out easily, then scrape off with a knife.</p>

them in green hemlock boughs when they are to be had, and
in 24 hours they will be cleansed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How to Shoot Snipe.</span>&mdash;To the beginner no bird is more
puzzling, and, therefore, more difficult to shoot. Its flight
is most uncertain, most variable, and most irregular&mdash;rising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
at one time as evenly as a lark, and flying close to the
ground with scarcely the slightest deviation from a straight
line; at another, springing from the ground as if fired from
a gun, and then flying in a zig-zag course to the right or left,
and, indeed, in every direction; and sometimes, again, rising
to a great height, and then going straight away with the
rapidity of lightning. And yet, with all these apparent difficulties,
when the knack is once acquired, it becomes comparatively
easy&mdash;indeed, is reduced almost to a certainty.
The great art in this kind of shooting is coolness, and to
avoid too much hurry. And, in this, as in every other kind
of shooting, the first sight is the best; the moment you are
“well on” your bird, the trigger should be pulled. In cross
shots, fire well before your bird. Contrary to the usual practice,
you should always walk down wind; the reason for this
is that snipe always rise against it. Sometimes snipe are
very wild, and at others will lie until they are almost trodden
upon. If there be much wind, your best chance is to “down
with them” as soon as they rise from the ground, or you
have little hope of getting a bag.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Preseveratives for Skins.</span>&mdash;The best material for the
preseveration of skins of animals consists in powdered arsenious
acid, or the common arsenic of the shops. This
may be used in two ways: either applied in dry powder on
the moist skin, or, still better, mixed with alcohol or water
to the consistency of molasses, and put on with a brush.
Some camphor may be added to the alcoholic solution, and a
little strychnine will undoubtedly increase its efficacy. There
are no satisfactory substitutes for arsenic, but, in its entire
absence, corrosive sublimate, camphor, alum, etc., may be
employed.</p>

<p>Many persons prefer the arsenical soap to the pure arsenic.
This is composed of the following ingredients, arsenic, 1
ounce; white soap, 1 ounce; carbonate of potash, 1 dram;
water, 6 drams; camphor, 2 drams. Cut the soap into thin
slices, and melt over a slow fire with the water, stirring it
continually; when dissolved, remove from the fire, and add
the potash and arsenic by degrees; dissolve the camphor in
a little alcohol, and when the mixture is nearly cold, stir
it in.</p>

<p>The proper materials for stuffing out skins will depend
much upon the size of the animal. For small birds and
quadrupeds, cotton will be found most convenient; for the
larger, tow; for those still larger, dry grass, straw, sawdust,
bran, or other vegetable substances, may be used. Whatever
substance be used, care must be taken to have it perfectly
dry. Under no circumstances should animal matter,
as hair, wool, or feathers, be employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The bills and loral region, as well as the legs and feet of
birds, and the ears, lips and toes of mammals, may, as most
exposed to the ravages of insects, be washed with an alcoholic
solution of strychnine applied with a brush to the dried
skin; this will be an almost certain safeguard against injury.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Fishing with Natural Fly.</span>&mdash;This consists in fishing
with the natural flies, grasshoppers, etc., which are found
on the banks of the rivers or lakes where you are fishing.
It is practiced with a long rod, running tackle, and fine line.
When learning this system of angling, begin by fishing close
under the banks, gradually increasing your distance until
you can throw your live bait across the stream, screening
yourself behind a tree, a bush, or a cluster of weeds, otherwise
you will not have the satisfaction of lifting a single fish
out of the water. In rivers where immense quantities of
weeds grow in the summer, so as almost to check the current,
you must fish where the stream runs most rapidly, taking
care that in throwing your line into those parts you do not
entangle it among the weeds. Draw out only as much line
as will let the fly touch the surface, and if the wind is at
your back it will be of no material service to you in carrying
the fly lightly over the water. In such places the water is
generally still, and your bait must, if possible, be dropped
with no more noise than the living fly would make if it fell
into the water.</p>

<p>Keep the top of your rod a little elevated, and frequently
raise and depress it and move it to and fro very gently, in
order that the fly by its shifting about may deceive the fish
and tempt them to make a bite. The instant your bait is
taken, strike smartly, and if the fish is not so large as to
overstrain and snap your tackle, haul it out immediately, as
you may scare away many while trying to secure one. There
are very many baits which may be used with success in
natural fly fishing, of which, however, we shall content ourselves
with enumerating some of the most usual and useful.</p>

<p>Wasps, hornets and bumble bees are esteemed good baits
for dace, eels, roach, bream and chub; they should be dried
in an oven over the fire, and if not overdone, they will keep
a long while.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">How to Select Furs.</span>&mdash;In purchasing furs, a sure test of
what dealers call a “prime” fur is the length and density of
the down next the skin; this can be readily determined by
blowing a brisk current of air from the mouth against the
set of fur. If the fibers open readily, exposing the skin to
the view, reject the article; but if the down is so dense that
the breath cannot penetrate it, or at most shows but a small
portion of the skin, the article may be accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">To Clean Furs.</span>&mdash;Strip the fur articles of their stuffing
and binding, and lay them as much as possible in a flat position.
They must then be subjected to a very brisk brushing,
with a stiff clothes brush; after that, any moth-eaten parts
must be cut out, and be neatly replaced by new bits of fur
to match. Sable, chinchilla, squirrel, fitch, etc., should be
treated as follows: Warm a quantity of new bran in a pan,
taking care that it does not burn, to prevent which it must
be actively stirred. When well warmed, rub it thoroughly
into the fur with the hand. Repeat this two or three times;
then shake the fur, and give it another sharp brushing until
free from dust. White furs, ermine, etc., may be cleaned as
follows: Lay the fur on the table, and rub it well with bran
made moist with warm water; rub until quite dry, and afterward
with dry bran. The wet bran should be put on with
flannel, and the dry with a piece of book-muslin.</p>

<p>The light furs, in addition to the above, should be well
rubbed with magnesia, or a piece of book-muslin after the
bran process. Furs are usually much improved by stretching,
which may be managed as follows: to a pint of soft
water add three ounces of salt; dissolve; with this solution
sponge the inside of the skin (taking care not to wet the fur)
until it becomes thoroughly saturated; then lay it carefully
on a board with the fur side downward, in its natural disposition,
then stretch as much as it will bear, to the required
shape, and fasten with small tacks. The drying may be
quickened by placing the skin a little distance from the fire
or stove.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Fishing with Artificial Fly.</span>&mdash;Artificial fly fishing consists
in the use of imitations of these flies and of other fancy
flies, and is unquestionably the most scientific mode of
angling, requiring great tact and practice to make the flies
with neatness and to use them successfully, and calling
forth as it does so much more skill than the ordinary method
of bottom fishing, it merits its superior reputation.</p>

<p>It possesses many advantages over bottom fishing, but at
the same time it has its disadvantages; it is much more cleanly
in its preparations, inasmuch as it does not require the angler
to grub for clay and work up a quantity of ground baits, and
is not so toilsome in its practice, for the only encumbrances
which the fly fisher has are simply a light rod, a book of flies
and whatever fish he may chance to catch; but there are
several kinds of fish which will not rise at a fly, and even
those that do will not be lured from their quiet retreat during
very wet or cold weather. It would be well if the young
angler could go out for some little time with an old experienced
hand, to observe and imitate his movements as closely
as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Prepare Sheep Skins for Mats.</span>&mdash;Make a strong
lather with hot water and let it stand till cold; wash the fresh
skin in it, carefully squeezing out all the dirt from the wool;
wash it in cold water till all the soap is taken out. Dissolve
a pound each of salt and alum in two gallons of hot water,
and put the skin into a tub sufficient to cover it; let it soak
for twelve hours, and hang it over a pole to drain. When
well drained stretch it carefully on a board to dry, and stretch
several times while drying. Before it is quite dry, sprinkle
on the flesh side one ounce each of finely pulverized alum
and saltpetre, rubbing it in well.</p>

<p>Try if the wool be firm on the skin; if not, let it remain
a day or two, then rub again with alum; fold the flesh sides
together and hang in the shade for two or three days, turning
them over each day till quite dry. Scrape the flesh side
with a blunt knife, and rub it with pumice or rotten stone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">To Tan Sheep Skins.</span>&mdash;Sheep skins, which are used for a
variety of purposes, such as gloves, book-covers, etc., and
which when dyed, are converted into mock Morocco leather,
are dressed as follows: They are first to be soaked in water
and handled, to separate all impurities, which may be
scraped off by a blunt knife on a beam. They are then to
be hung up in a close, warm room to putrefy. This putrefaction
loosens the wool, and causes the exudation of an oily
and slimy matter, all which are to be removed by the knife.
The skins are now to be steeped in milk of lime, to harden
and thicken; here they remain for 1 month or 6 weeks,
according to circumstances, and when taken out, they are
to be smoothed on the fleshy side with a sharp knife. They
are now to be steeped in a bath of bran and water, where
they undergo a partial fermentation, and become thinner in
their substance.</p>

<p>The skins, which are now called pelts, are to be immersed
in a solution of alum and common salt in water; in the proportion
of 120 skins to three pounds of alum and five pounds
of salt. They are to be much agitated in this compound saline
bath, in order to become firm and tough. From this bath they
are to be removed to another, composed of bran and water,
where they remain until quite pliant by a slight fermentation.
To give their upper surface a gloss, they are to be trodden in
a wooden tub, with a solution of yolks of eggs in water, previously
well beaten up. When this solution has become transparent,
it is a proof that the skins have absorbed the glazing
matter. The pelt may now be said to be converted into
leather, which is to be drained from moisture, hung upon
hooks in a warm apartment to dry, and smoothed over with
warm hand-irons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Trap Young Mink.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mink Breeding.</span>&mdash;Adult minks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
are almost untamable, but young ones readily submit to
handling, and are easily domesticated. The time to secure
young minks is in May and June, when they begin to run with
their dams. The streams must be quietly watched for mink
trails, and these tracked to the nest.</p>

<p>When they leave the hole the old one may be shot, and
the young ones secured, or they may be dug out. Those
who own a breeding stock of minks ask high prices for
them; but trappers represent to us that it is an easy matter
to get the wild young ones. <em>Habits.</em>&mdash;A successful breeder
says that he does not attempt to tame the wild mink, but
only aims to supply for it in a small space all the necessities
of its natural instincts. He says the mating season commences
about the first of March, and lasts two weeks, never
varying much from that date.</p>

<p>The female carries her young about six weeks. In the
minkery, where diet, water, temperature, etc., are similar
with each animal, there is so little difference in the time of
mating and time of bearing young in different animals, that
five out of six litters dropped last spring, were born within
twelve hours of each other. The young are blind from four
to five weeks, but are very active, and playful as kittens.
The mother weans them at from eight to ten weeks old. At
four weeks the mother begins to feed them meat; this they
learn to suck before they have teeth to eat it.</p>

<p>The nests in which the young are born are lined by the
mother with some soft material, and are made in the hollow
of some old stump, or between the projecting roots of some
old tree, and always where it is perfectly dry. The nest is
located near pure running water, which the mother visits
twice every twenty-four hours. She feeds her young on frogs,
fish, birds, mice, crabs, etc., etc. The mink is from birth a
pattern of neatness and cleanliness, and as soon as a nest
begins to get foul and offensive, she takes one of the young
in her mouth, and depositing it in a clean, suitable place,
builds a nest about it, and then brings the balance of the litter.
She feeds and cares for them until they are three and a
half or four months old. When the young are weaned, about
the 10th of July, she builds her nest near the water, in which
the young soon learn to play. There are usually four in a
litter, though the number ranges from two to six. Towards
fall the mother separates them into pairs. One pair&mdash;or if
the number be odd, the odd one&mdash;is left in the nest; the other
pair or pairs, she places them often half a mile from each
other, and then seeks new quarters for herself.</p>

<p>The young soon separate, and each one catches his own
frogs, etc. They do not pair, but the male is a sort of rover
and free-lover. Minks are unsociable, petulant, vicious in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
play, savage in war. Late in the fall they establish regular
runaways from one stream to another, and usually under
brush-fallen trees, weeds swale, and under banks&mdash;anywhere,
in fact, where they can avoid the sunshine, and escape the
chances of observation. The mink is a sure prophet, and
just before hard winter begins, he lays by a store of food for
the winter in safe places near his winter nests, of which he
has several. As the snows fall he burrows under the snow,
where he remains until about February, when his supply of
food is exhausted, and he is forced to seek further for food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Management of.</span>&mdash;Mink being by nature solitary, wandering
creatures, being seldom seen in company except during
the breeding season, are, therefore, impossible to be reared
successfully, if large numbers are kept constantly together,
therefore their inclosure should be a large one.</p>

<p>The male and female should be permitted to be together
frequently from the middle of February until the middle of
March. At all other times keep them entirely separate.
The young mink make their appearance about the first of
May. When wild in the woods they will seldom vary five
days from this time, but when kept in confinement there is
greater variation. About this season they should have
plenty of fine hay, which they will carry into their boxes to
make nests. A box three or four feet long and eighteen
inches wide is the shape they prefer. It should be placed as
far as possible from the water to prevent the mink from carrying
water and mud into it.</p>

<p>The young mink when first born are small and delicate,
destitute of any kind of fur, and much resembling young
rats. If the old mink is tame the young ones may be taken
out of the nest and handled when they are three weeks old.
They will soon learn to drink milk, and may feed every day.
At five weeks old they may be taken from the mother and put
into a pen by themselves, when they will soon become very
playful and pretty, and make much better mothers than they
would if allowed to run with the old ones.</p>

<p>The shelter should be in the shape of a long box, 5 or 6
feet wide, and 3 or 4 feet high, set upon legs, and with a
good floor and roof. Divide it into separate compartments,
6 feet long (or longer would be better,) the front of each
apartment to be furnished with a swinging door of strong
wire screen, with the hinges at the top, and a button or some
kind of fastener at the bottom. A trough 6 inches square,
made by nailing three boards together, should run the
whole length of the pen on the back side; one end of the
trough should be made several inches lower than the other,
so that the water can be drawn off. With this arrangement,
the water can be turned in at one end of the trough, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
drawn off and changed as often as desired. The lower end
of the trough should be a little deeper than the other, to prevent
the water from running over. Each apartment is furnished
with a box 3 feet long and eighteen inches wide. On
one side of the box and near one end is made a round hole,
<span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> inches in diameter, and provided with a sliding cover
so that by means of a stick it can be opened or closed from
the outside.</p>

<p>This is so the mink can be shut up when the pen is being
cleaned out. On the top of the box and at the other end
should be a door large enough to put in hay for the nest and
take out the young. It is necessary that they have abundance
of pure, soft water, fresh air, desirable shade and
plenty of exercise. These conditions secure to the mink a
good quality of dark fur and good health. Brush, weeds,
etc., are allowed to grow in the yard, but not near enough
the wall to admit of their climbing up and out.</p>

<p>In addition to the above directions for breeding mink, we
give the following experience of a gentleman in Vermont:
“I purchased one female and her litter of five, two males and
four females in all, and constructed a building of rough
boards, 10 by 4 feet, for a minkery. It had a floor tight
enough to prevent the escape of the animals, was properly
ventilated, and divided into six apartments, one of which is
an ante-room in which to step from the outside and close the
door. Water is supplied by a lead pipe running in at one
side through all the rooms, and out at the other into a
trough where small fish are kept, and occasionally given to
the minks.</p>

<p>“They were kept together until December the 18th, when
the males were put in an apartment by themselves. On the
10th of March each male was put in with a female, each pair
separate, and after a couple of days, one of the males was put
in with another female, and finally with the third. They were
separated about the 1st of April, each female being kept
alone and supplied with a suitable box, with warm material
for a nest. When it was supposed they were about to bring
forth their young, they were disturbed as little as possible;
anything to excite them at this time, should be avoided, for
when irritated, they will sometimes eat their young. The
first female put with the perfect male, brought forth seven,
one of which disappeared after they began to crawl around
out of their nest. The other two females had each a pair, all
of which (but the one mentioned) are now alive, fine, fat,
sleek fellows, and fully grown. They are very easily kept,
being fed once a day upon warm milk with wheat bread
crumbs&mdash;a quart sufficing for the whole lot, and once upon
fresh meat, care being taken not to over-feed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Any kind of meat and offal that is not too fat will answer.
They are very fond of beef liver, chickens’ heads and entrails,
woodchucks (being careful not to give them the gall
or the liver, which is poisonous), rats, mice, etc. They are
more easily cared for than one hog and much more cheaply
kept. Nothing was paid out for meat for them until after
1st July, when a contract was made with a butcher to leave
a bullock’s head once a week. I am confident that the increase
of the minkery would have been fully one-third more
if both the males had been perfect. I intend to keep them
in pairs hereafter. They are not easily handled, but struggle
when caught against their will and exude the thick fetid
substance from glands near the vent. They will bite severely,
but can be handled safely with thick buckskin gloves.”</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
